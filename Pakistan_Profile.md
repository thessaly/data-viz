## B8 – Other

### B8.1 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

Yes, while Pakistan is committed to aligning with the 2021 UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science, several external factors may pose challenges to its full and timely implementation. One of the primary issues is the limited access to international funding mechanisms specifically dedicated to open science initiatives. Without sustained external financial support, scaling infrastructure, developing open-access platforms, and training researchers may progress more slowly. Additionally, unequal access to global research infrastructure such as high-end digital repositories, open-source software, and collaborative platforms can hinder effective participation in international open science practices. Pakistan’s research institutions often rely on foreign technologies and platforms, which may come with access restrictions, subscription costs, or licensing limitations that affect openness and interoperability. Another key external barrier is the lack of globally harmonized standards for open science data sharing and governance. This can create legal, ethical, and technical uncertainties when collaborating across borders, especially in joint research and data exchange. Despite these challenges, Pakistan continues to engage in international scientific discussions and remains optimistic about building partnerships to address these limitations
