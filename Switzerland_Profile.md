### B2.4: National implementation plan / roadmap
The Action Plan for ORD, developed under the leadership of swissuniversities and
in collaboration with SNSF, ETH Domain and science academies, concretizes the
measures of the National ORD Strategy adopted in 2021. Based on the objectives
set forth in the ORD Strategy, four action areas are defined in the Action Plan:
i) Support for researchers, research communities, and institutions on adopting
ORD practices.
ii) Development, promotion, and maintenance of ORD infrastructures and
services.
iii) ORD skills development and exchange of best practices.
iv) Building up systemic and supportive conditions: incentives and rewards, ethical
and legal aspects, international alignment.
The Swiss National ORD Strategy Council—a new governance entity uniting the
senior office holders of these institutions—coordinates the implementation of the
Action Plan, with a specific focus on open science research infrastructures. In
addition, the Swiss ORD community—two sounding boards, consisting of
researchers and service providers from the ERI institutions—also supports the
strategic development and implementation of ORD measures.

### B2.5: Institutional open science policies
Swiss institutions have implemented comprehensive policies embodying key
elements of open science that promote OA to research outputs, foster collaboration,
and enhance transparency. For example:
Universities:
• With the implementation of its open science policy in 2021, the University of
Zurich fosters an open academic culture that embodies the National OA
Strategy of swissuniversities (see 2.2) and the Open Science Roadmap of the
League of European Research Universities (LERU). The policy prioritizes three
areas of action: (i) public and free access to scientific resources (e.g., data,
codes, and publications); (ii) improved research methods that reflect the
reproducibility, replicability, transparency and efficiency of scientific results;
and (iii) a cultural change in university structures that includes changes to
assessment of scientific achievements:
https://www.uzh.ch/en/researchinnovation/ethics/openscience.html
• The University of Bern actively promotes open science through a range of
institutional services and infrastructures. These include support for OA
publishing, research data management, and long-term data preservation.
Additionally, a dedicated open science team, in collaboration with the university
library, organizes regular courses and workshops on open science-related
topics for the university’s researcher community:
https://www.ub.unibe.ch/services/open_science/index_eng.html
Universities of Applied Sciences/ "Haute École Spécialisée" (HES):
• Since 2018, the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW) has promoted
open science. It supports the National OA Strategy through an institutional OA
policy and managing an institutional repository through its University Library. It
also advances the Swiss National ORD Strategy with research data services
and training. Additionally, ZHAW fosters Open Educational Resources (OERs)
as part of the Education and Digital Transformation strategy (2018–2029) and
the ZHAW OER Policy, recommending that teaching materials be published
under free licenses like CC BY or CC BY-SA:
https://www.zhaw.ch/de/fokusthemen/open-science
• University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Western Switzerland (HES-SO):
launched in December 2018, the Open HES-SO Strategy aims to make all
HES-SO research publications and data openly accessible. The Open Science
HES-SO Community, established in October 2020, now includes around 90
members across various fields and roles (researchers, professors, librarians,
publishers, lawyers, scientific assistants, etc.). It serves as a hub for reflection,
experience-sharing, and action on Open Science, organizing quarterly plenary
sessions and dedicated working groups on key topics:
https://www.hes-so.ch/recherche-innovation/open-science
https://www.hes-so.ch/fileadmin/documents/HES-SO/Documents_HES-
SO/pdf/open-science/2018-Strategie-Open-HES-SO-12321.pdf
ETH Domain:
• In 2019, EPFL (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne) adopted its
OA policy, requiring all research results to be published in OA, with mandatory
deposit in the institutional repository. This policy aligns with EPFL’s broader
Open Science strategy, which fosters a cultural shift driven by researchers and
research communities. The evolving strategy outlines EPFL’s path toward
institutional change by promoting open communities, open infrastructure, open
knowledge, and societal engagement. By ensuring maximum visibility for
research results, the OA policy strengthens this framework, advancing
knowledge dissemination, outreach, and the development of open
infrastructure and communities:
https://www.epfl.ch/about/overview/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/LEX-
3.5.1_EN.pdf
https://www.epfl.ch/research/open-science/
• Since 2018, ETHZ (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich) implemented
its OA policy, requiring researchers to make all research outputs publicly
accessible via the institutional repository:
https://rechtssammlung.sp.ethz.ch/Dokumente/134.pdf
https://ethz.ch/en/research/open-science.html

### B2.6: National funding mechanisms for open science
Switzerland has established specific national funding mechanisms to support open
science initiatives:
• The funding scheme Open Science Programme II (2025-2026)—a continuation of
its predecessor, Open Science Programme I (2021-2024)—is based on the Swiss
National Strategies for OA and ORD. It supports developments along the axes of
OA, ORD, and innovative areas for open science through knowledge transfer
between various stakeholders in academia, industry, and society:
https://www.swissuniversities.ch/en/topics/open-science/open-science-
programme
• The ETH Domain ORD Program financially supports researchers across six Swiss
public research institutions—PSI (Paul Scherrer Institute), WSL (Swiss Federal
Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research), Empa (Swiss Federal
Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology), Eawag (Swiss Federal
Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology), ETHZ (Swiss Federal Institute of
Technology Zurich), and EPFL (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology
Lausanne)—to advance ORD practices. The program funds five key measures
(see also 2.3): (i) field-specific actions, (ii) coordinating RDM services, (iii)
developing RDM training courses, (iv) addressing legal RDM issues, and (v)
creating career paths for ORD professionals. Funds are awarded along
“Establish” (links existing ORD practices to broader research agendas), “Explore”
(tests early-stage practices), and “Contribute” (integration into existing, often
global infrastructures) axes:
https://open-research-data-portal.ch/projects/
https://ethrat.ch/en/the-five-measures-in-details/
• In line with the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)’s mandate for full and
immediate access to publicly funded research outputs (see also 2.2), it provides
financial support for OA publishing of research articles, books, and book chapters.
These funds cover publisher's services for quality assurance, production and
distribution, article processing charges, and proofreading. Additionally, the SNSF
funds other aspects of open science, including open dialogue between scientists
and society as well as science communication training for researchers:
https://www.snf.ch/en/A7fep1IPxz1XezVS/page/find-funding-
scheme?category=DQkA46U4rzqBqIBR%3B&page=0

### B2.7: Open science integrated into research funding
Most funding instruments in Switzerland include requirements concerning Open
Access and Open Research Data. For example, the SNSF requires all publicly
funded research outputs to be publicly and freely accessible:
https://www.snf.ch/en/dah3uC2QX95tfPNd/topic/open-science

### B2.8: Public-private partnerships for open science
While specific exchanges with private actors on open science practices exist, they
have not been structured into a coherent national framework concerning equitable
public-private partnerships on open science.

### B2.9: National monitoring framework for open science
The Swiss Open Access Monitor is the national framework for monitoring of Open
Access to scientific publications. The monitor provides basic indicators for
visualizing the progress of the Swiss National OA Strategy across two types of
resources: OA journals and OA repositories. It was developed within the framework
of the National Open Access Monitoring (NOAM) project, led by the Consortium of
Swiss Academic Libraries, and funded by the Open Science programme 2021-
2024 and the Consortium. This framework is further being developed.
Link:https://oamonitor.ch
There is no national monitoring framework when it comes to Open Research Data,
although SNSF has been monitoring uptake of ORD across its funding schemes:

DaSCH is accessible by the FAIR-Principle:
https://www.dasch.swiss
§ Swiss Centre of Expertise in the Social Sciences (FORS): provides social
science researchers in Switzerland (and abroad) with various data services
(e.g., collection and analysis, archiving, management) and tools for
information infrastructure:
https://forscenter.ch
All of the listed infrastructures are non-commercial as they are developed and
maintained by academic, governmental, or publicly funded institutions with the
goal of supporting open science, collaboration, and research infrastructure
rather than commercial profit-making.
• community managed infrastructures, protocols and standards, for example
those that support bibliodiversity and engagement with society
§ Materials Cloud: a service operated by the MARVEL National Centre of
Competence whose Leading House is the Swiss Federal Institute of
Technology Lausanne (EPFL), and is hosted at the Swiss National
Supercomputing Center (CSCS) in Lugano, while being supported by an
international community of researchers. Materials Cloud provides open-
access computational tools, curated datasets, and educational resources

physics:
https://opendata.cern.ch/
§ Swiss Digital Research Infrastructure for Arts and Humanities (DARIAH-
CH): aims to build a national network that enhances and supports digitally
enabled research and teaching across the arts and humanities. The
network fosters collaboration among Swiss researchers and institutions, as
well as international partners. Coordinated by the DaSCH, member
institutions include the universities of Basel, Bern, Lausanne, Geneva, and
Zurich, the ETH Domain (EPFL, ETHZ Library), universities of applied
sciences, and the Swiss National Museum:
https://www.dariah.ch
§ CLARIN-CH: As part of the European CLARIN network, CLARIN-CH brings
together Swiss researchers working on language-related issues and
provides them with digital infrastructure for linguistic resources, including
tools, web services, and knowledge centers, along with opportunities for
collaboration in joint national and European projects. Aligned with the FAIR
principles, it facilitates interoperability and data sharing across institutions
and disciplines and supports multilingual and culturally diverse research in
the humanities and social sciences:
https://clarin-ch.ch
§ Linguistic Research Infrastructure (LiRI): based at the University of Zurich,
LiRI provides advanced digital tools and services for linguistic research in
Switzerland. It supports researchers with data collection, processing, and
analysis across various languages and disciplines:

bioinformatics resources for life sciences research and data in Switzerland
and beyond for academic and clinical research:
https://www.sib.swiss
§ Swiss Personalized Health Network (SPHN): promotes the standardization
and interoperability of health data across Swiss research institutions and
hospitals:
https://sphn.ch
All of the listed infrastructures are non-commercial.
• platforms for exchanges and co-creation of knowledge between scientists and
society
Citizen Science Zurich: hosted by the University of Zurich (UZH), this Swiss
platform fosters collaboration and dialogue between researchers and citizen
scientists to conceptually shape research methodologies and questions across
various socially relevant sectors such as health, education, energy, and
environment. For example, as part of the study “FICUS” (Family Support
Intervention in Intensive Care Units), funded by the Swiss National Science
Foundation, workshops are organized involving patients, family members, and
health researchers to co-design a “mixed methods” evaluation of patient and
public involvement (PPI) and partnership in health research. These exchanges
help to define indicators and practical recommendations to improve future user-
researcher collaboration and PPI, ultimately enhancing the relevance and
effectiveness of health research for patients and their families.
Citizen Science Zurich is a non-commercial platform supported by public
funding from UZH and ETHZ, and currently hosts over 30 active projects, some
with open science resources like MOOCs and teaching materials:
https://www.citizenscience.uzh.ch/en.html
https://www.citizenscience.uzh.ch/en/projects/ficus.html
• community-based monitoring and information systems to complement national,
regional and global data and information systems.
Citizen Science Zurich encourages community-level involvement in scientific
research through active data collection and interpretation in projects across
sectors. For example, the project “Swiss Photovoltaic Journeys” invites
participation from homeowners with solar energy installations, to share data on
specific questions (e.g., what initiated their interest in solar energy?; costs,
problems, and electricity bills over the years). By collecting and sharing real-
world experiences from photovoltaic system owners, the project aims to provide
transparent data and insights to encourage wider adoption and optimize system
performance:

### B3.5: Participation in federated international infrastructure
Yes, many infrastructures mentioned under 3.4 operate as federated regional or
international OS infrastructures. It is particularly common for Swiss infrastructures
to be nodes in European Union federated infrastructures such as the European
Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC).
Switzerland participates in numerous ERICs, which allows Swiss researchers to
make use of internationally coordinated research infrastructures while also
coordinating the further development of their own scientific fields. Swiss
membership of any one ERIC is ultimately decided by the Federal Council and
voted by the ERIC General Assembly, while the SNSF and SERI are involved in
membership procedures:
https://www.sbfi.admin.ch/sbfi/en/home/research-and-innovation/international-
cooperation-r-and-i/eric.html#-745063428
Switzerland is currently active in six ERICs, including the DARIAH ERIC (Swiss
node: Swiss National Data and Service Center for the Humanities DaSCH).
Switzerland also holds “observer” status in four ERICs, including the European
Social Survey (ESSurvey) ERIC (Swiss node: Swiss Centre of Expertise in the
Social Sciences FORS) and the CLARIN ERIC (Swiss node: LiRI @ University of
Zurich / CLARIN-CH).
Swiss infrastructures are also commonly embedded in other, informal networks of
infrastructures at regional or international level, that operate with a level of
federation.

### B3.6: North-South / South-South infrastructure collaborations
Through institutions like the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS),
Swissuniversities Development and Cooperation Network (SUDAC), and initiatives
such as Excellence in Africa (EXAF), Switzerland supports multinational research
efforts, open-access data, and digital education. These partnerships contribute to
global scientific progress, including in the Global South, by providing advanced
computational resources, fostering innovation, and aligning with the U.N.
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Key initiatives include:
§ CSCS: as part of ETH Zurich, it provides data infrastructure for the Square
Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO)—the world’s largest radio telescope, with
arrays in South Africa and Australia, and the Cherenkov Telescope Array
Observatory (CTAO)—a next-generation gamma-ray observatory with a key
site in Chile:
https://www.cscs.ch/
§ SUDAC: seeks targeted support for collaboration between the various types of
Swiss higher education institutions and their partners from the Global South to
achieve an excellent standard of education, research and innovation on global
challenges. To achieve its aims, the SUDAC programme has promoted the
development of two instruments:
o 'Consortia for Education and Research (COFER)' that are oriented
towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the U.N.
Agenda 2030. COFER MOOLS, a joint project by EPFL and HES-SO,
enhances digital education through online labs in countries like Iran,
Niger, Lebanon, and Djibouti:
o Clusters of Cooperation in the Global South' (CLOCs) are expected to
serve as ‘regional hubs’, connecting a variety of ‘nodes’, such as
existing research and education partnerships, regionally active COFER,
local knowledge platforms and institutions.

## B4: Education, Capacity Building & Science Communication

### B4.1: Systematic capacity building on open science
§ Structured capacity-building initiatives on open science within higher education
institutions are supported by the swissuniversities PgB Open Science II
instrument, which, for example, provides funding for training ORD specialists
and data stewards across Swiss universities:
https://www.swissuniversities.ch/themen/open-science/programm-open-
science
§ The ETH Domain ORD program, which focuses on advancing ORD practices
within the ETH Domain institutions, aims to enhance ORD knowledge,
management, infrastructure, and skills through five defined measures:
https://ethrat.ch/en/eth-domain/open-research-data/
§ National initiatives have supported relevant networks to foster informal capacity
building, particularly for data stewards and research software engineers. The
longstanding Swiss Library Network for Education and Research has been
instrumental in building Open Science capacity within libraries:
https://www.swissuniversities.ch/en/organisation/bodies/networks-and-
agencies/swiss-library-network-for-education-and-research

### B4.2: Capacity building for policymakers
Targeted capacity-building programmes on for STI policymakers remains an area
that requires further development. Obstacles may include competing priorities
within policymaking bodies as well as a gap in awareness in these communities
regarding the importance of including Open Science into national policies.

### B4.3: Open science competencies in higher education curricula
No national framework exists. However, individual higher education institutions
have integrated aspects of open science competencies (e.g., research data
management, OA publishing) into their curricula, primarily at the doctoral level.

### B4.5: Science communication initiatives
Switzerland actively promotes science communication to foster scientific dialogue
with multiple audiences. Examples include:
• The Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) supports science
communication between researchers as well as communication between
researchers and the public. It therefore awards grants for scientific meetings
and publications as well as for projects that foster dialogue between science
and society:
https://www.snf.ch/en/EXrMdruJNhNtvdMg/page/funding/science-
communication
• Following the heightened demand for public engagement with science after
COVID-19, the Swiss Academies of Arts and Sciences formed the expert group
“Communicating Sciences and Arts in Times of Digital Media”. Representing
diverse disciplines, institutions, and linguistic regions, the group assessed
science communication in Switzerland. In 2021, they published a
comprehensive report highlighting its strengths and providing 20
recommendations to enhance public engagement and embed science
communication into scientific culture and practice:
https://akademien-schweiz.ch/en/themen/science-communication/
• Pint of Science: an annual event that brings researchers to local bars and cafés
to share cutting-edge discoveries in their field with the public. The next edition
is scheduled in May 2025:
https://pintofscience.ch/
§ In addition to this physical event, Pint of Science is also accessible as a podcast
(https://pintofscience.ch/podcast) and short videos (Shot of Science,
https://pintofscience.ch/shots-of-science) .
• Swiss higher education institutions offer various courses to help young
researchers communicate science effectively.
• Communication initiatives are also in place for specific scientific fields, such as
ZettaBytes (EPFL), which promotes and explains big ideas of computer
science to a general audience

## B5: Research Assessment & Incentives

### B5.1: Review of research assessment processes
§ Currently, 19 Swiss institutions have signed the Coalition for Advancing
Research Assessment (CoARA), including: ETH Domain research institutions
such as EPFL and ETH Zurich, major universities (e.g., University of Geneva,
University of Fribourg, and University of Lausanne), universities of applied
sciences in Bern and Zurich, Swiss academies of arts and sciences,
universities of teacher education, the university umbrella organization,
swissuniversities, and Switzerland’s primary scientific research funder, the
Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF). As part of their commitment to this
international initiative, and in alignment with the Agreement on Reforming
Research Assessment, each Swiss signatory is expected to submit an
institutional Action Plan. These plans will outline how they intend to align their
research evaluation practices to CoARA’s principles, of which Open Science,
and in particular the recognition of the diversity of contributions, is an important
component, while integrating them within existing institutional frameworks:
https://coara.eu/agreement/the-agreement-full-text/
https://coara.eu/agreement/signatories/?category%5B0%5D=switzerland#sig
natories
§ In addition to institutional-level engagement, the Swiss National Chapter of
CoARA unites Swiss universities and funding agencies, encompassing
Switzerland’s diverse language regions and higher education landscape. It is
expected to foster a more coordinated and systematic approach to research
evaluation reform, aligning with European and international developments:
https://coara.eu/working-groups/national-chapters/coara-national-chapter-
switzerland/

### B5.2: Open science practices in career evaluation
From 2022, the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) introduced a “narrative
CV” across its funding schemes. This CV format gives more flexibility to
researchers to explain their scientific achievements beyond mere publications and
explicitly includes “contributions to (i) the generation of knowledge, innovation, and
advancement of research, (ii) the development and support of peers and the wider
research community, and (iii) Broader Society”.
https://www.snf.ch/en/gKcnwW6aEft4bMPF/page/your-curriculum-vitae-all-about-
the-cv-format

### B5.3: Initiatives to recognise/reward open science practices
§ Since 2023, the Academies of Sciences Switzerland have been awarding the
National Prize for Open Research Data (ORD) as part of the ORD Action Plan,
implemented under the National Strategy for Open Research Data. This prize
recognizes researchers for innovative practices in open research and
encourages the transition to more transparent and collaborative research
methods. For the 2024 competition, the prize focused on two key areas: (i)
collaborative and/or interdisciplinary reuse of research data, and (ii)
educational and/or outreach activities related to data reuse.The four winning
projects were: Pathoplexus (University of Basel), ROADS (Zurich University of
Applied Sciences, ZHAW), openwashdata (a global initiative led by ETH
Zurich), and ENAC-IT4Research (EPFL). The ORD Prize is expected to be re-
awarded in 2025.
https://ord.swiss-academies.ch/national-ord-prize/overview
§ The SNSF actively supports open access (OA) and open research data (ORD)
through funding requirements. While the SNSF does not yet have a dedicated
open science award, it provides funding incentives for researchers
implementing open science principles.

## B6: Societal Engagement & Open Innovation

### B6.1: Innovative participatory / societal engagement practices
§ Promotion of pre-prints: In accordance with Switzerland’s National Open Access
Strategy, the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) mandates open
access for all publications resulting from publicly funded research, supporting
dissemination through various open-access channels, including preprints. While
no explicit policies on preprints exist, SNSF-funded researchers are clearly
engaged in the preprint culture:
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-021-00891-
x?utm_source=chatgpt.com
https://www.snf.ch/en/MDecEyLJgpSTk0cU/page/open-access-information-
for-researchers
§ Valuing and sharing of negative scientific results and associated data: the
Swiss National Open Research Data (ORD) Strategy and Action Plan aim to
create optimal conditions for the access, management, and reuse of publicly
financed research data aligned with the FAIR principles, which naturally
includes the sharing of negative scientific results and data.
https://www.swissuniversities.ch/en/topics/open-science/open-research-
data/national-strategy
§ participatory methods that value inputs from societal actors, e.g. citizen science,
crowdsourcing scientific projects: development of participatory strategies for
identifying the needs of marginalized communities and highlighting socially
relevant issues to be incorporated into research agendas: While specific
initiatives targeting marginalized communities are not explicitly detailed in the
available sources, platforms like Citizen Science Zurich, based at the University
of Zurich (UZH) in collaboration with ETH Zurich, promote participatory
approaches that inherently encourage inclusivity. These methods help integrate
pressing social issues into research across various sectors, including health,
energy, environment, and education, by involving a diverse range of participants.
This includes cancer survivors, youth and elderly individuals with specific
conditions (e.g., hearing loss, mental illness), and women, ensuring that
research reflects and addresses their unique experiences and challenges.
Moreover, indigenous communities play a vital role in participatory research,
such as in anthropology. For instance, a project at the Ethnographic Museum
at the University of Zurich engaged Wounaan people from Colombia and
Panama to explore artifacts from their culture. Their contributions were
instrumental in deepening the understanding of material culture, traditional
knowledge, and the role of artisan collections, fostering meaningful dialogue
between researchers and originator societies.
https://www.citizenscience.uzh.ch/en/projects.html
https://www.citizenscience.uzh.ch/en/projects/wounaan.html
§ promoting open innovation practices.
§ The Open Science Programme II of swissuniversities, scheduled to run
from 2025 to 2026, aims to strategically advance open innovation across
three key dimensions, supported by project-related federal contributions
(PgB) totalling CHF 6.45 million. It will do so by:
Enhancing capacities for scientific collaboration through the implementation
of the goals and measures of:
(i) the Swiss National OA Strategy; and
(ii) the Swiss National ORD Strategy; and by
(iii) promoting innovative areas for Open Science, specifically designed to
facilitate knowledge and technology transfer between universities,
businesses, and society, as well as by fostering science diplomacy and
international collaboration, thereby broadening the impact of open
innovation both nationally and globally:
https://www.swissuniversities.ch/fileadmin/swissuniversities/Dokumente/H
ochschulpolitik/Open_Science/2025/PgB-Open-Science-II-2025-2028-
Implementationsplan.pdf
§ Innosuisse, the Swiss Innovation Agency, supports open innovation by
fostering collaboration between researchers, start-ups, and established
companies. For example, the first generation of thematic ‘Innovation
Booster’ initiatives supported by Innosuisse was concluded at the end of
2024. Launched in 2021, these thematic initiatives which serve as a
springboard for promoting a culture of co-creation and collaboration across
innovation hubs like Energy Lab, Swiss Food Ecosystems, and Bloackchain
Nation Switzerland, have made a significant contribution to redefining the
approach to innovation in Switzerland. The first signs of the long-term
impact these initiatives is seen in local projects such as E4citizens, aiming
to initiate discussions and collaboration around greener energy practices
within local organizations and communities using a gamified tool, testifying
to the democratization of open innovation in a number of sectors. In addition,
programmes such as the diversity-focused Women's in Energy Lab & Life
(WELL) are demonstrating their ability to address societal challenges, such
as the underrepresentation of women in technical fields:

https://energylivinglab.com/departments/e4citizens/
https://energylab.site/wp-
content/uploads/2021/01/Gender_equity_EnergyLab1-1.pdf
§ Innosuisse also runs innovation cheques worth up to CHF 15k to help Small
and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) connect with research institutions
for open innovation by assessing the viability, market potential, and
collaboration potential of their innovation concepts:

## B7: International Cooperation

### B7.1: Promoting international scientific collaborations on open science
Swiss research and its higher education landscape are highly connected at the
international level. It has become even more so in recent years with a constant
increase in student mobility, internationalization of university teaching staff, and
the interest of researchers in cooperating with European and global partners. For
example, an evaluation prepared for the State Secretariat for Education, Research
and Innovation (SERI) in 2020 on Switzerland’s bilateral cooperation programmes
in science and technology showed that, during the period 2007-2017, among eight
European countries (Austria, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway,
Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom), Switzerland had the highest share
of collaborative publications with all countries every year. In 2017, this share was
66%—that is, two-thirds of all Swiss publications were prepared in collaboration
with researchers from at least one foreign country.
Link: https://irisgroup.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/EVALUA1.pdf
This openness in collaboration naturally extends to and demonstrates
Switzerland’s strong engagement in OS practices, OS initiatives and
infrastructures, etc. The necessary support for international collaborations is
provided by the SERI:
https://www.sbfi.admin.ch/sbfi/en/home/research-and-innovation/international-
cooperation-r-and-i.html

### B7.2: Cross-border multi-stakeholder collaboration strategy
No specific strategy exists, however Swiss actors are involved in many European
and international networks, as well as the EU-wide framework programme Horizon
Europe (see 7.3), which facilitate the natural exchange of best practices, capacity
building, and metrics for open science. Even without a formal strategy or plan,
these activities are still taking place

### B7.3: Regional/international funding mechanisms for open science
Switzerland is not involved, to the best of our knowledge, in such discussions.
However, Switzerland participates in the EU Framework Programme, the most
recent edition of which, Horizon Europe (2021–2027, EUR 95.5 billion), is the
largest research and innovation funding programme in the world. This programme
contains several mechanisms for open science funding, in which Switzerland is
therefore a party. For example, Horizon Europe mandates open access to
publications and research data and recommends other open practices as
appropriate, such as open peer review and the inclusion of citizens as key
knowledge actors.

## B8: Other / Additional Comments

### B9: Other comments
Switzerland is a federal country with a decentralized culture of governance. This
extends to the research sector. The UNESCO Recommendation cannot be
implemented as a single, top-down process, but requires that all actors in the Swiss
research ecosystem (ministry, national-level entities, higher-education institutions),
engage with it and implement it at their level. The answers in this questionnaire
reflect this reality
