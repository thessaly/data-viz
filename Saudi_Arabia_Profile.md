# Country Profile: Saudi Arabia

*UNESCO 2021 Recommendation on Open Science — Survey Responses*

---

## Key Indicators

**R&D expenditure (% GDP):** Research and Development (R&D) expenditure is a vital metric reflecting a country's commitment to scientific progress, technological innovation, and economic diversification. In Saudi Arabia, R&D has become an essential pillar of the Kingdom's Vision 2030, aiming to diversify the economy, enhance technological capabilities, and reduce reliance on oil revenues. In 2022, Saudi Arabia allocated 0.46% of its GDP to R&D sa.pdf. As the Kingdom aims to increase its R&D expenditure to 2.5% of GDP by 2040, the future looks promising for Saudi Arabia’s continued growth as a regional leader in scientific research, technological innovation, and economic diversification. The rising investment in human capital and the growing role of the private sector will be key drivers of this transformation

**Internet access rate:** Saudi Arabia’s internet accessibility and bandwidth availability have made impressive strides, with the country now boasting an internet penetration rate of 99%, in 2023 (Link). This is a clear reflection of the nation's commitment to digital transformation and technological advancement under the Vision 2030 framework. The high-speed internet infrastructure available across the Kingdom supports not only the daily lives of citizens but also the growth of key sectors such as education, research, business, and innovation. As the country continues to roll out 5G and expand fiber-optic networks, Saudi Arabia is well-positioned to be a regional leader in digital connectivity and bandwidth capacity.

## B2 – Open Science Policies and Governance

### B2.1 — Share a machine-readable PDF file of the policy

Saudi Arabia embarked on enormous national efforts supplemented with wide-spectrum global consultations to prepare a national research, development, and innovation strategy (RDI Strategy) that is aimed to fulfill the national aspirations by 2050, including: a. Become a top 26 nation and 1st in the MENA region by 2030 (according to the Global Innovation Index), b. Reach budget envelope of 115 B SAR in RDI expenditure by 2040 (equivalent to ~2.5% of GDP), c. have 140,000 researchers employed in KSA by 2040, d. Create ~360,000 jobs by 2050, (5) achieve ~230 B SAR GDP contribution by 2050. The Research, Development, and Innovation Authority (RDIA) is responsible for implementing and overseeing the RDI strategy. The development process involved collaboration among various stakeholders, including government ministries, academic institutions, research centers, and industry partners. This collaborative approach ensured that the strategy addresses national priorities and leverages the Kingdom's strengths. The Strategy focuses on four national priorities: a. Health and Wellness: Advancing medical research and healthcare innovations to improve public health outcomes. b. Sustainable Environment and Supply of Essential Needs: Ensuring sustainable access to water, food, and energy resources. c. Energy and Industrial Leadership: Promoting advancements in energy technologies and enhancing industrial capabilities. d. Economies of the Future: Fostering innovation in emerging fields to diversify and strengthen the economy. These priorities are designed to position Saudi Arabia as a global leader in research and innovation, contributing to economic diversification and addressing global challenges. a) The strategy emphasizes collaboration across government entities, academia, and industry to drive innovation and address the nation's strategic priorities. 24 b) These initiatives reflect Saudi Arabia's commitment to fostering a robust STI ecosystem that supports sustainable development and economic growth. c) For more detailed information, please visit the official RDIA website: https://www.rdia.gov.sa/media/bt3h3psk/economies-of-the-future-rdi- national-priority-in-saudi-arabia-analytical-study_full-study.pdf The RDI strategy, which is still under development and confidential at this stage, has replaced the previous National Plan for Science and Technology, which was approved and implemented in 2002 (att. 1).

The KSSO’s primary mission is to raise public awareness about science and technology. Future plans include enhancing collaboration with policy- making organizations to align with national open science objectives. Furthermore, there are some efforts from the national universities and research centers to develop implementation plans, strategies, policies, or roadmaps for the implementation of open science at the national or organizational level in line with the 2021 Recommendation, which could be highlighted as follows: 1. Al-Jouf University is currently in the process of developing an implementation plan and roadmap for open science in line with the 2021 UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science. The roadmap aims to incorporate open science values and principles into the university’s research ecosystem, ensuring equitable sharing of knowledge and addressing challenges such as data exploitation, privacy, and inequalities in research funding. The Council of Universities Affairs, and Research, Development, and Innovation Authority (RDIA), other universities, industry partners, and community organizations are among the supporting national entities to the implementation plan. 2. KAUST's New Strategy has been developed to achieve stronger international collaboration & partnerships, global integration and open access policies, collaboration with high-tech, high-talent areas through 51 hubs and partnerships, and platforms to accelerate innovation using world- leading research standards. KAUST supports research publishing by offering many open-access publishing agreements in 2024. These transformative agreements allow KAUST’s corresponding authors to publish their accepted articles in open-access mode and thus be made openly available at no cost to the author or with a discount. The library subscription covers the publishing charges in "Read and Publish" deals. APC (article processing charges) discount deals provide an agreed discount on the APC, while KAUST authors pay the discounted APC. When KAUST doesn't have an open-access publishing deal with the publisher, KAUST authors are advised to submit an author-accepted version of their paper to KAUST Research Repository.

## B3 – Open Science Infrastructure

### B3.1 — What is the latest official data for your country’s percentage of national gross domestic product (GDP) dedicated to research and development expenditure? Please also indicate the year of publication of this data, and to which year(s) it refers.

Research and Development (R&D) expenditure is a vital metric reflecting a country's commitment to scientific progress, technological innovation, and economic diversification. In Saudi Arabia, R&D has become an essential pillar of the Kingdom's Vision 2030, aiming to diversify the economy, enhance technological capabilities, and reduce reliance on oil revenues. In 2022, Saudi Arabia allocated 0.46% of its GDP to R&D sa.pdf. As the Kingdom aims to increase its R&D expenditure to 2.5% of GDP by 2040, the future looks promising for Saudi Arabia’s continued growth as a regional leader in scientific research, technological innovation, and economic diversification. The rising investment in human capital and the growing role of the private sector will be key drivers of this transformation

### B3.2 — What is the latest official data for the percentage of your country's population that have access to reliable internet and bandwidth? Please also indicate the year of publication of this data, and to which year(s) it refers

Saudi Arabia’s internet accessibility and bandwidth availability have made impressive strides, with the country now boasting an internet penetration rate of 99%, in 2023 (Link). This is a clear reflection of the nation's commitment to digital transformation and technological advancement under the Vision 2030 framework. The high-speed internet infrastructure available across the Kingdom supports not only the daily lives of citizens but also the growth of key sectors such as education, research, business, and innovation. As the country continues to roll out 5G and expand fiber-optic networks, Saudi Arabia is well-positioned to be a regional leader in digital connectivity and bandwidth capacity.
