The Launching of Palestine researchGate: https://researchgate.ps/#/  , https://researchgate.ps/#/page/PALNREN: Palestinian National Research & Education Network PALNREN Introduction:  Scientific research is considered one of the key factors contributing to the advancement of human societies, especially those striving for sustainable development. It is a true measure of the progress and civilization of nations, as it generates knowledge and technology that improve reality. The reputation of research institutions is closely linked to the value and quality of the research they produce, which helps define their leadership at local, regional, and international levels.  National Research and Education Networks (NRENs) focus on providing high-quality network connections and related services to universities and research institutions by connecting them with each other and the internet. These networks aim to provide integrated services to students, researchers, educators, and staff at university campuses, as well as to schools, libraries, hospitals, and other public institutions. They also contribute to providing technical support in areas such as security, storage, collaboration, and trust.  A research network in any advanced country is considered a key enabler of scientific research and leadership across various fields. Research and education networks aim to build and develop local research capacities in all fields by establishing a national high-speed communication network that offers advanced information services, stimulating researchers to increase their research activities and enhancing the quality of their output. Additionally, these networks work to unify efforts in distributing educational resources and optimizing financial resources, while expanding to open doors to similar global networks, enabling local researchers to connect with international peers and participate in research resources and services offered by other universities locally and internationally, such as high-performance computers, cloud services, joint programs, and quantitative research results.  Some of the services provided by research and education networks include video conferencing, lecture and conference streaming over the network, facilitating direct communication between researchers, and easy data transfer for their projects without the need for travel or delays caused by traditional data transfer methods. They also offer educational roaming (EDU Roam), allowing researchers to move between universities within the same country or across institutions sharing the same service.  Furthermore, some research and education networks offer a unified subscription to global digital libraries and central library systems. They also provide services for student information systems (SIS), learning management systems (LMS), enterprise resource planning (ERP), and other applications for managing university campuses and educational processes in the country. These networks aim to train national experts in network management, create virtual scientific communities, and enrich the community with the latest knowledge releases, offering local researchers the opportunity to directly communicate with global experts in various fields.    Vision of the Network:  The Palestinian Research Network aims to empower innovation, scientific research, and education in Palestine through local and international strategic collaboration between the research and educational communities. The network seeks to establish a strategic partnership with the Palestinian Telecommunications Company (Paltel) and other telecom service providers to build, operate, and maintain this network. It also strives to support its members in utilizing and producing knowledge, increasing research capabilities, and innovating new ideas, patents, and products, thus advancing scientific research activities in Palestine and enhancing Palestine's leadership role in the region.

## B2: Open Science Policies & Governance

### B2.2: National policies/legal frameworks aligned with Recommendation
Currently, there is no national policy or set of policies specifically addressing open science or its key elements in line with the 2021 Recommendation on Open Science. The main obstacles include a lack of awareness and understanding of open science principles among policymakers, insufficient funding for open science initiatives, and the absence of a legal framework to support open data sharing, open access publishing, and collaborative research. Additionally, there is limited infrastructure for implementing open science practices, and existing research policies do not explicitly address the need for open science.  There are discussions within certain academic and scientific circles regarding the development of such policies, but concrete plans and actions are still in early stages

### B2.3: Specific policy instruments promoting open science
At present, there are no specific policy instruments in place to promote open science in the country. While there may be individual initiatives within academic institutions or research organizations, these are not part of a national or coordinated effort. The absence of dedicated programmes, methods, or operational mechanisms to address open science challenges means there is a lack of structured support for advancing open data, open access, and collaborative research practices. This gap is compounded by limited resources allocated to such initiatives, and the lack of clear indicators or goals for evaluating their effectiveness.

### B2.4: National implementation plan / roadmap
A national implementation plan for open science is currently under development in Palestine. This is being coordinated by the Palestinian National Commission for Education, Culture, and Science, which recently held a specialized workshop on "Open Science Practices in Palestine." The workshop aimed to discuss the UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science and its related principles.  The workshop involved various key stakeholders, including:  Dr. Duwas Duwas, Secretary-General of the National Commission and President of the Executive Council of ISESCO Rania Jaber, Director-General of the Technology Innovation and Creativity Center at the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology Mahmoud Hawamda, Director of the Digital Education Center at Al-Quds Open University Dr. Amin Nawahda, Deputy Director-General of Development and Scientific Research at the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research Dr. Majdi Ouda, holder of the UNESCO Chair in Data Science at the Arab American University The discussions emphasized the importance of Palestine's participation in global scientific networks to encourage Palestinian researchers' access to open resources. The National Commission is working towards formulating a national framework for open science, coordinating with relevant institutions to define national needs and capacities.  A key recommendation from the workshop was the formation of a local open science working group and the establishment of mechanisms for international collaboration. This group will draft a report on Palestine's progress in open educational resources, which will be submitted to international organizations by the end of the month.

### B2.6: National funding mechanisms for open science
Currently, there are no specific funding mechanisms at the national level dedicated to open science in the country. The primary funding sources for research are generally directed toward specific scientific projects or institutions, without particular focus on open science initiatives such as open data, open access publishing, or infrastructure for open science. The absence of dedicated funding mechanisms for open science is partly due to a lack of awareness about the importance of such initiatives and insufficient alignment of national research funding priorities with open science principles.  Additionally, there is a limited budget for innovation, digital infrastructure, and science communication, which hinders the development of sustainable open science practices.  However, there are ongoing discussions to explore the potential for creating dedicated funding mechanisms for open science, and efforts are being made to align national funding strategies with global open science trends.

### B2.7: Open science integrated into research funding
( https://researchgate.ps/#/page/repositories)Research Repositories in Palestinian Universities  Research repositories in Palestinian universities represent one of the fundamental pillars for promoting scientific research and disseminating knowledge. These repositories provide access to scientific studies, theses, articles, and other academic materials produced by universities. They also contribute to enhancing academic collaboration among researchers locally and internationally.  Below is a list of research repositories in Palestinian universities along with their access links:  Islamic University – Gaza IUGSpace An-Najah National University Scholar Najah Al-Azhar University – Mishkat Birzeit University – FADA Palestine Polytechnic University Scholar PPU Palestine Technical University – Kadoorie Scholar PTUK Al-Quds Open University – Osoul Al-Aqsa University Scholar Al-Aqsa University of Palestine DSPACE UP Al-Istiqlal University – Tamayouz Al-Quds University DSPACE Al-Quds Arab American University – Wasm Hebron University DSPACE Hebron Bethlehem University DSPACE Bethlehem University College of Applied Sciences DSPACE UCAS Importance of Research Repositories  Promoting Open Access: Enhancing open dissemination of scientific knowledge. Improving Accessibility: Facilitating access to academic and research materials. Supporting Sustainability: Advancing academic efforts to achieve sustainable development.

### B2.8: Public-private partnerships for open science
Currently, there have been no significant efforts or plans to foster equitable public-private partnerships specifically focused on open science in the country. The development of such partnerships faces several challenges, including limited awareness of the importance of open science in both public and private sectors, a lack of clear incentives for private companies to engage in open science practices, and the absence of formal frameworks to encourage collaboration in this area.  Additionally, the public sector has limited capacity and resources to engage with private companies on open science initiatives, and private sector players may not yet see the direct benefits of contributing to open access, open data, and collaborative research practices.  However, there is potential for future development, and some discussions have been initiated on how public-private collaborations could help bridge the gaps in open science, especially if funding and policy support are improved. These discussions may lead to concrete actions by the end of 2025.

https://connect.geant.org/2024/09/09/eumedplus-strengthening-digital-connectivity-and-innovation-in-the-eus-southern-neighAlgeria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestine, Syria and Tunisia as a group are part of what is known as the European Union’s Southern Neighbourhood countries. With their predominantly young population experiencing significant unemployment rates, there is an urgent need for investment in human capital to foster economic growth, create societal opportunities, and mitigate brain drain.  Enter: the research and education (R&E) sector. R&E networks are crucial in this effort, particularly through digital transformation, which enables access to high-speed internet, data infrastructures, and e-services that are essential for collaboration, innovation, and evidence-based decision-making  For this reason and building on the successes of previous EU-funded projects – such as AfricaConnect and EUMEDCONNECT, the EU co-funded EUMEDplus project was launched on 1 September 2024. Aligned with the Agenda for the EU’s partnership for the Southern Neighbourhood, EUMEDplus aims at enhancing the capabilities of NRENs in North Africa and their Regional Network, the Arab States Research and Education Network (ASREN), and increasing access to modern digital infrastructure and technologies.  With a four-year timeline and a budget of 13,334,000 euros – of which 12,000,000 euros are contributed by the European Union – the project is coordinated by GÉANT with key partners including ASREN, the American University of Beirut, the Centre National pour la Recherche Scientifique et Technique in Morocco, the Cyprus Research and Academic Network, NORDUnet, and SESAME in Jordan. The partners will work collaboratively to ensure that the project’s objectives are met and that its impact is felt across the Southern Neighbourhood.  The project is designed to address key challenges in digital connectivity in the EU’s Southern Neighbourhood as a catalyst for human capacity development. EUMEDplus aims to achieve this ambition by:  Supporting Research and Education: in particular, by strengthening the role of ASREN and North African NRENs in driving digital transformation within the R&E sector. The project aims to enable them to participate more fully in global scientific collaboration and innovation by enhancing their maturity and sustainability development as well as operational efficiency, both at regional and national level. It will also prioritise gender equality-oriented initiatives through dedicated conference tracks, mentorship programmes and training courses. Elevating Digital Infrastructure: in order to significantly improve access to modern digital infrastructures and technologies, the project will aid North African NRENs in developing and implementing national strategies to fully utilise the pan-Mediterranean Medusa submarine-cable project, EU’s first digital global Gateway undertaking, and also investigate the feasibility of expanding the Medusa system, now between North Africa and Europe, towards the Levant, whist ensuring ongoing international R&E connectivity for the Levant. Expanding the service offering: the project will empower NREN to tackle the challenge of making data infrastructure scalable and value-added services and tools that are accessible to end users. The focus will be on establishing the underlying federation systems for secure service access, fostering cross-border cooperation in HPC utilisation and promoting the adoption of open science principles. EUMEDplus is set to play a transformative role in the Southern Neighbourhood by enhancing digital infrastructure, supporting educational and research institutions, and fostering sustainable, inclusive growth. Through its focus on long-term sustainability, gender equality and high-speed connectivity, the project promises to bridge the digital divide and stimulate innovation, ensuring that the Southern Neighbourhood is well-positioned to thrive in the digital age.
