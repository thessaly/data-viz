## Key Indicators

**R&D expenditure (% GDP):** In relation to gross domestic product, there will be a year-on-year decline in this expenditure, from 1.89% in 2022 to 1.83% in 2023 (Note: These figures are in line with the latest results of the CSO's extraordinary revision of the national accounts of 28 June 2024. They differ from the figures in this article, which were published before the revision). The aforementioned decline is thus already in its third year - i.e. since 2020, when the share of research expenditure in GDP reached 1.95%. (viz https://vedavyzkum.cz/politika/politika-vyzkumu-a-vyvoje/vydaje-na-vyzkum-a-vyvoj-v-roce-2023-stouply-na-140-miliard-korun-v-pomeru-k-hdp-vsak-klesly-na-1-83)

**Internet access rate:** In the second quarter of 2022, 85% of Czech households were connected to the internet. (https://statistikaamy.csu.gov.cz/k-internetu-jsou-pripojeni-skoro-vsichni)

### B2.3 — Please provide details and links as relevant, including for each instrument: Title of the instrument, its objective, the authority in charge, allocated budget, elements of open science included

Until 2020, we had the Czech National Strategy for OA to Scientific Information for 2017-2020 (including publications and data) + Action Plan for its implementation. However, OA was not mandatory and this policy is not valid any more. In 2020, the Czech Government approved the National RDI Policy of the Czech Republic 2021+ as an overarching national-level strategic document for advancing all components of RDI. This document helps fulfill certain criteria of the basic conditions to be able to draw funding from EU funds in the 2021–2027 programming period (https://vyzkum.gov.cz/FrontClanek.aspx?idsekce=913172) There is a requirement to create an Action Plan following the Action Plan to the National Strategy for OA to Scientific Information of the Czech Republic for 2017-2020. No action plan was delivered yet.

### B2.4 — Please provide details and links as relevant, including the name of ministries and national authorities/entities, as well as affiliated organizations that are involved in the development and implementation of the plan, strategy or the roadmap

The new national Open Science strategy should begin preparation in 2025.

## B3 – Open Science Infrastructure

### B3.1 — What is the latest official data for your country’s percentage of national gross domestic product (GDP) dedicated to research and development expenditure? Please also indicate the year of publication of this data, and to which year(s) it refers.

In relation to gross domestic product, there will be a year-on-year decline in this expenditure, from 1.89% in 2022 to 1.83% in 2023 (Note: These figures are in line with the latest results of the CSO's extraordinary revision of the national accounts of 28 June 2024. They differ from the figures in this article, which were published before the revision). The aforementioned decline is thus already in its third year - i.e. since 2020, when the share of research expenditure in GDP reached 1.95%. (viz https://vedavyzkum.cz/politika/politika-vyzkumu-a-vyvoje/vydaje-na-vyzkum-a-vyvoj-v-roce-2023-stouply-na-140-miliard-korun-v-pomeru-k-hdp-vsak-klesly-na-1-83)

In the second quarter of 2022, 85% of Czech households were connected to the internet. (https://statistikaamy.csu.gov.cz/k-internetu-jsou-pripojeni-skoro-vsichni)

### B3.3 — Please provide more information and links as relevant, and indicate to which open science actors in your country those networks are accessible

CESNET is an association of universities of the Czech Republic and the Czech Academy of Sciences. It operates and develops the national e-infrastructure for science, research and education which encompasses a computer network, computational grids, data storage and collaborative environment. E-infrastructure provides services to transfer, process and store data for the needs of Research and Educational community (https://www.cesnet.cz/en).

### B3.4 — For each infrastructure, please provide links as relevant and more information with regard to their compliance with the 2021 Recommendation on Open Science in terms of inclusivity, accessibility, interoperability, community governance, FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) and CARE (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility and Ethics) principles. Please indicate if the infrastructure is non-commercial

e-INFRA CZ stands as a unique e-infrastructure (non-comemercial) dedicated to research and development in the Czech Republic. It provides a transparent environment offering comprehensive capacities and resources for the transfer, storage and processing of scientific data to all entities engaged in research and development, regardless of the scientific domain. The core activities of e-INFRA CZ as a whole gradually shift towards adhering to the FAIR principles. The following steps in the national EOSC development plan envolve great number of research institutions, which will together implement so-called National Data Infrastructure with National Repository Platform in its heart. Together with this infrastructure for repositories, several EOSC-related services will be implemented, encompassing solutions for PIDs, AAI, Data Management Planning, scientific data collaboration platforms, and more. At the same time, this infrastructure will become the inherent part of the national IT research environment provided by the e-INFRA CZ. (https://www.e-infra.cz/en).

### B3.5 — Please provide links as relevant and more information, including the name of the infrastructure, date of establishment, language, target groups and beneficiaries, governance/community agreements, scope

CEITEC Nano Infrastructure has reservation system with automated data storage and data.description (https://openscience.muni.cz/en/open-science-at-muhttps://nano.ceitec.cz/). Czech Literary Bibliography Research Infrastructure - The Data Management Plan (DMP) provides information about the lifecycle of data as it is generated, collected, processed, stored, and shared within the Czech Literary Bibliography Research Infrastructure. (https://clb.ucl.cas.cz/en/research-data-management/).  A recognized data-management-plan(ning) supporting tool Data Stewardship Wizard (DSW) is developed in Czech Republic. This tool has increased in popularity of its use in the Czech Republic and other countries and is recommended by the Horizon Europe Programme Guide (https://ds-wizard.org/) please provide links as relevant and more information, including the name of the infrastructure, date of establishment, language, target groups and beneficiaries, governance/community agreements, scope (e.g. research areas, elements of open sciencei, stage of research, accessibility to all the relevant users in the region or internationally).

## B4 – Education, Capacity Building & Science Communication

### B4.1 — Please indicate if those capacity building initiatives are formal or informal and provide more information and links as relevant

Since 2023, the EOSC CZ Training Centre has provided support and facilities for training, educational and related activities. The Training Centre cooperates with research institutions in the preparation of tailor-made courses on specific topics related to Data Management and Open Science. An overview of available training in the Czech Republic is advertised on the Training centre website https://www.eosc.cz/en/training.  There are also sources provided by Open Science centres of the universities (Masaryk University - https://openscience.muni.cz, Charles University - https://openscience.cuni.cz/OSCI-1.html, Silesian University in Opava - https://www.slu.cz/, etc.) a by theNational Library of Technology - https://www.techlib.cz/cs/84873-open-science. There is also increasing Data Steward comunity - the data steward, a newly established role in research data management, plays a crucial part in ensuring the quality and integrity of data throughout the research cycle. This includes the responsible handling of data, from its creation and preparation to use and storage to archiving and sharing or reuse. The data steward's role is to ensure that data management is carried out in accordance with defined principles, policies and rules that support data quality and integrity.

### B4.2 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

Given the somewhat fragmented environment in Open Science, capacity building is currently in the hands of individual institutions. See above.

### B4.3 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

Individual institutions prepare training schemes independently. For example Palacký University Olomouc organises a series of ten modules delivered as part of the whole-life training offered to all staff and PhD students (content includes research data management, introduction to open science, commercialisation of research, ethics of scientific work, etc.), which is  held twice a year. Link: https://openscience.upol.cz/zprava/clanek/kurzy-otevrene-a-zodpovedne-vedy-jiz-potreti.  Moreover, formal and informal communities of e.g. data-stewards and  open science specialists (which are active e.g. on social networks - Discord, or under the aegis of the Association of University Libraries or the Czech Association of Research Managers and Administrators) are a certain link and a possible germ of a national approach. Charles University is gradually incorporating open science competencies in educational programs. The most recent example is the MSCA COFUND project Charleston (https://cuni.cz/UKEN-2185.html) aimed at postdoctoral researchers includes training courses based on the ResearchComp (The European Competence Framework for Researchers). This training is expected to be extended for doctoral students as well. Charles University is also activelly involved in a series of webinars "Open for you!" (https://4euplus.eu/4EU-273.html) which are prepared for all member universities accross 4EU+ university alliance.  Beyond these examples, the University Open Science Support Centre orgnises ad hoc trainings for researchers as well as for research support staff. University of Chemistry and Technology Prague has for Bc. students: elementary information regarding copyright, Open Access and basic OS elements (DOI, ORCID, ROR) is included as part of the „Chemical Informatics“ course (mandatory course).

### B4.5 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

Already in 2019, the Technology Agency of the Czech Republic funded the project TL02000013 "Quality Assurance of Open Educational Resources: how to create and use freely available learning materials properly" (2019-2021). The project developed a) a certified methodology, which is a methodological tool for creating Open Educational Resources suitable for university studies. In addition, a methodological portal was developed, which summarises the methodological knowledge for the creation of OER through a series of materials on the topic (texts, videos, images) and also provides an interactive space for users. Based on the methodological knowledge, a freely available online course (MOOC) was also created for the staff of Charles University and the general public. The methodological portal and the online course will be available after the end of the project to promote critical evaluation of sources as a defence against misinformation. A very useful national communication channel is the portal https://vedavyzkum.cz/, where open science appears ad hoc and rather marginally. At our university we have a position of science popularizer, who takes a conscious approach to science communication in line with open science value and principles. National Library of Technology is organizing Doctoral Summer School which focuses on topics of Open Sciency, Communication in Research, Career management and similar topics: https://www.techlib.cz/en/84767-doctoral-summer-school-2023. There are initiatives to support the dissemination of scientific results among the general public and other researchers. For example, there is a national event hosted annually called "Researchers' Night" during which participating institutions open their doors to the public and educate visitors on various aspects of the fields of research they offer. The field of open science is gaining importance in academia and university libraries are often the institutions that address and engage with open science topics in the field of education (students, academic and technical-economic staff) and science and research. The role of the Association of University Libraries of the Czech Republic is to anchor libraries in the university environment: a more active role in supporting study/research and greater involvement in key university processes. The Association is involved in Open Science initiatives.  Already in 2010, the Open Access Initiative of the Czech Republic was established within the Association, as an informal group of academic librarians who have long been working on the issue of open access to scientific information and building open repositories. The importance of the OA Initiative was confirmed by the Association signing the Berlin Declaration in 2012 and by its membership in the international organisation SPARC Europe (since 2015). 2021, then the Open Science Working Group (OS WG) was established, which continues the work of the Open Access Initiative and aims to monitor all relevant trends in the field of open science, and , for example, organizes the Open Science Week (3 days of practical demonstrations, experience sharing and lively discussions).

## B5 – Research Assessment and Incentives

### B5.1 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

One of the indicators in the new methodology for the evaluation of research organisations in the higher education segment (Methodology 25+) concerning the sustainability and resilience of RPOs is the concept of Open Science (https://msmt.gov.cz/uploads/Hodnoceni_2025/Metodika_VS2025/Metodika_VS2025_.pdf). National Recovery Plan: EXCELES Programme The EXCELES programme of the National Recovery Plan emphasises open science. Procurement documents in Section 4. Subject Matter states that grantees should share research results (both publications and research data) in accordance with the well-known "as open as possible, as closed as necessary" rule, i.e., as open as possible, closed as necessary. The Technology Agency of the Czech Republic supports applied research. In the KAPPA Programme, funded by the EEA and Norway Grants, there is an obligation to ensure open access for all scientific articles resulting from a research project, in the form of Green Open Access or Gold Open Access. Each research project funded under this programme must also prepare its own data management plan. The Czech Science Foundation thus supports open access publishing on a voluntary basis. Beneficiaries are obliged to develop a research data management plan.

### B5.2 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so.

here is no generally applicable framework that recommends this. However, open science as such, its principles and practices are developing and can be expected to find their way into career evaluation systems etc.

### B5.3 — For each initiative, please provide more information, including on the stakeholders[i] that are involved or lead the initiative, and links as relevant.

One of the indicators in the new methodology for the evaluation of research organisations in the higher education segment (25+ methodology) concerning the sustainability and resilience of RPOs is the concept of Open Science. For example, at the end of 2024, the Czech Academy of Sciences approved a new strategic document, the Principles of Open Science of the CAS, which represents the basic framework and recommendations for the implementation of the principles of open science at CAS institutions. The CAS, through its institutes, has long been building and implementing open access to scientific information generally adhering to standards of scientific integrity. The CAS sees this as a path to greater quality, transparency, sustainability and reproducibility of research. The CAS also welcomes the fact that the sharing of scientific data and other digital objects in accordance with the FAIR principles (Findable-Accessible-Interoperable-Reusable) is becoming a new reality and standard in research. The CAS subscribes to the principles of Open Science in line with its commitment to disseminate research findings as widely as possible and in accordance with UNESCO recommendations and the anchoring of Open Science in national, European and international science policy. The need for greater openness of science and wider access to scientific results and data is also mentioned in the Code of Ethics for Researchers of the CAS. (https://openscience.lib.cas.cz/open-science/institutional-policies/) In 2022, Brno University of Technology became a signatory of the Agreement on Reforming Research Assessment and a member of the CoARA coalition. The CoARA Action Plan for BUT was also developed. https://www.vut.cz/en/rad/evaluation; Charles University takes an active role in initiatives aiming to reform research assessment and evaluation - it is one of COaRA members and seeks to implement its principles into internal evaluation schemes (see  Charles University COaRA Action Plan 2024: https://zenodo.org/records/12545583). Palacký University Olomouc signed the Agreement on Reforming Research Assessment (ARRA) in July 2023, thereby committing to the need to change the culture in the R&D area and R&D evaluation, which is still overly focused on metrics, inappropriately in at least some research fields. Although some necessary steps towards this change have already been taken before joining ARRA (i.e., the first and comprehensive international peer-review evaluation based on self-evaluation in 2023, work on a strategy for Open Science and responsible Research data management is in the process thus far), we feel the philosophy of ARRA needs to be declared officially and further developed and anchored at this institution. Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (MoEYS) - Johannes Amos Comenius Programme: Immediate and complete OA, CC licenses, DMP, FAIR data, OS procedures as part of the evaluation criteria: Call: Research Excellence Call: Call for proposals to improve results in research, development and innovation, called: Cross-sectoral cooperation Call: Social Sciences and Humanities: Man and Humanity in Global Challenges National Recovery Plan: EXCELES Programme The EXCELES programme of the National Recovery Plan emphasises open science. Procurement documents in Section 4. Subject Matter states that grantees should share research results (both publications and research data) in accordance with the well-known "as open as possible, as closed as necessary" rule, i.e., as open as possible, closed as necessary.

### B5.4 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

It is mostly the increase in costs for publications, lots of publications in predatory or potentially predatory journals. The phenomenon of predatory journals still appears here and there, but the bigger problem from our point of view seems to be the questionable practices of some established publishers (increase of special issues in journals, high APCs, short and questionable peer review process). There are initiatives by some institutions and universities to discuss this phenomenon and to warn authors about possible pitfalls. A useful initiative is https://www.stoppredatorypractice.com. On the level of individual researchers, Open Science is often felt to be a lot of work for little gain, especially as the overall funding of research is considered to be rather low so the additional costs of implementing open science practices (APCs, data stewards...) are often viewed as a waste of resources. Moreover, the evaluation schemes don't take these additional efforts into consideration yet. For example improving research data management requires not insignificant amount of resources (time, trainings, infrastructure) which are difficult to get by and researchers are rarely evaluated for the additional efforts.  Regarding scholarly communication, Czech researchers are conservative in viewing highly impacted journals as the pinnacle of publishing and it is difficult for them to accept anything different than traditional, highly impacted journals as the right venue to publish best research. Moreover, some Czech funders are still rewarding high impact publications which, in combination with open access mandate (e.g., in Czech P JAC funding scheme), results in a significant increase of publication costs (e.g., APC costs for Nature publications). Additionally, data migration can present challenges, especially when moving research data between platforms or repositories. This process can sometimes result in data loss or mismanagement if improperly handled. The lack of interoperability between different data platforms can also hinder the efficient sharing and reuse of research data, which is essential to open science principles. Another concern is the privatisation of research data, as some private companies may attempt to control access to data initially created as part of publicly funded research. This could result in the exploitation of publicly funded knowledge, where data or research outputs are not made available for broader societal benefit but are locked behind paywalls or commercial interests. High article processing charges (APCs) associated with some open access models remain a significant barrier for many researchers, especially in disciplines with less funding. These costs can disproportionately affect scientists from less affluent institutions or countries, exacerbating global inequalities in access to publishing opportunities and research dissemination.

## B6 – Engagement of Societal Actors & Open Innovation

### B6.1 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so.

For the time being, we have no information about similar initiatives or activities.

---

## B7 – International Cooperation

### B7.1 — How is your country promoting and facilitating international scientific collaborations on open science as outlined in the 2021 Recommendation on Open Science?

In 2010, the Open Access Initiative of the Czech Republic was established within the Association of Libraries of Czech Universities, which has long been working on the Open Access to scientific information and Open Repositories. The importance of the OA Initiative was confirmed by the Association signing the Berlin Declaration in 2012 and by its membership in the international organisation SPARC Europe (since 2015). In 2021, then the Open Science Working Group (OS WG) was established, which continues the work of the Open Access Initiative.

### B7.2 — If possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so.

The new national Open Science strategy should begin preparation in 2025.

### B7.3 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so.

The Czech Republic is promoting Open Science principles through initiatives and funding mechanisms described in previous points. However, this environment is fragmented and it is necessary to unify this topic at national level.
