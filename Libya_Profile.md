## B2 – Open Science Policies and Governance

### B2.1 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so

Although Libya has not yet developed a national policy, strategy, or action plan dedicated to science, technology, and innovation, the country has formulated a national strategy for the higher education sector. In addition, several organizations working in the field of science and technology have developed national strategies that contribute to the advancement of these areas. The National Committee for Open Science, which includes representatives from key sectors involved in promoting science, technology, and innovation, recognizes that these fields are essential drivers of sustainable development. Therefore, the National Committee for Open Science will advocate for the development of a national framework for science, technology, and innovation in Libya that is aligned with national priorities and contributes to sustainable development.

## B3 – Open Science Infrastructure

### B3.3 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so.

Libya does not have a specific body named the "National Research and Education Network (NREN)." In fact, research and education institutions in Libya operate under three different authorities, each with distinct responsibilities:  1. Ministry of Education – Responsible for compulsory education. 2. Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research – Comprising two separate entities:    - Libyan Authority for Scientific Research, which oversees 45 research centers.    - Libyan Universities**, which consist of 27 universities. 3. Ministry of Technical and Vocational Education– Oversees technical and vocational education institutions.  While there is no centralized NREN, these institutions contribute to research and education in Libya through their respective frameworks. However, the Libyan National Committee for Open Science understands the importance of an NREN for the country; therefore, the Committee will work with Libyan governmental institutions to highlight the need to establish one in Libya.

### B3.4 — For each infrastructure, please provide links as relevant and more information with regard to their compliance with the 2021 Recommendation on Open Science in terms of inclusivity, accessibility, interoperability, community governance, FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) and CARE (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility and Ethics) principles. Please indicate if the infrastructure is non-commercial

The Libyan education system is built on the principles of open science, focusing on enhancing access to education and ensuring open access to scientific publishing.  For example, the Libyan Ministry of Education succeeded in integrating all scientific journals affiliated with universities and research centers into a single platform "https://lsjp.epc.ly/ar/Journal". It stipulated that all these journals be open access, ensuring that scientific knowledge is freely available to researchers, students, and the wider community.  Moreover, Libya was one of the first countries to establish an open university in 1987 "https://ou.edu.ly/", pioneering the concept of open education and promoting higher education for all segments of society. This open education model has proven effective in expanding learning opportunities throughout Libya, especially in areas with limited access to traditional educational institutions.  Looking ahead, Libya aims to strengthen its commitment to open science through the following initiatives:  - Expanding digital platforms to facilitate the sharing of research outputs and datasets. - Encouraging the integration of open science policies into higher education institutions and research centers. - Developing national guidelines to support open publishing and open data repositories. - Implementing training programs to build researchers’ capacities in open science methodologies. - Enhancing international collaboration to align Libya’s open science initiatives with global standards.  While Libya has already taken significant steps in promoting open science principles, we recognize the need to further enhance our efforts by implementing innovative policies and developing infrastructure that ensures sustainable openness, accessibility, and collaboration in scientific research.

## B4 – Education, Capacity Building & Science Communication

### B4.1 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so.

No, systematic capacity building on open science has not yet taken place in Libyan higher education and research performing institutions. Although these institutions engage in various open science activities such as knowledge sharing and maintaining open access journals, they currently lack a formal and structured program dedicated exclusively to building capacity in open science. While foundational efforts exist, structured capacity building remains an area for further development.

## B5 – Research Assessment and Incentives

### B5.1 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

Yes, initiatives are expected to be developed as part of the newly established National Committee for Open Science. With the recent formation of the National Committee for Open Science, Libya is now in a stronger position to develop policies and initiatives that align research assessment and evaluation processes with open science principles and values. The committee is expected to propose and implement various reforms that encourage open-access publishing, and transparent research practices across academic and research institutions. To achieve this goal, the committee aims to: •	Review and modernize existing research evaluation frameworks to include open science indicators such as open-access publications, data sharing, and community engagement. •	Encourage universities and research centers to integrate open science policies into their institutional assessment and funding criteria. •	Promote the adoption of FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) for research data management. •	Develop national guidelines and policies to incentivize researchers to adopt open science practices and ensure their contributions to open knowledge are recognized and rewarded. •	Engage with international open science networks to align Libya’s research evaluation standards with global best practices. Although these initiatives are still in the early stages, the National Committee for Open Science is fully committed to ensuring that open science principles are embedded in the research assessment and evaluation framework by 2025. By doing so, Libya aims to increase research transparency, enhance collaboration, and ensure broader access to scientific knowledge for both academic and non-academic communities.

## B8 – Other

### B8.1 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

Yes, several factors have contributed to the delay in implementing UNESCO recommendation, which can be summarized as follows:  - Delay in appointing a National Focal Point:The official designation was only made in November 2024.   - Lack of dedicated funding: No funds have been allocated for promoting and implementing the 2021 UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science.    - Institutional and administrative challenges:Coordinating efforts among different ministries and research institutions has proven difficult.   - Limited awareness and promotion: Delays in the formal dissemination of the Open Science Recommendation have hindered widespread awareness among key stakeholders.    - Absence of a dedicated national policy or strategy: There is no established policy or strategy specifically for Open Science, which requires significant time for development and approval.    Despite the obstacles mentioned above, we strongly believe that the promotion of Open Science and the implementation of UNESCO’s recommendations will accelerate now that a National Focal Point has been appointed and the National Committee for Open Science has been established.    To ensure that the National Committee for Open Science achieves its goals, it includes senior officials from key stakeholders, including:    - Deputy Minister, Ministry of Education   - Deputy Minister, Ministry of Technical and Vocational Education   - President of the Libyan Open University - Deputy of the National Council for Social and Economic Development - General Manager of the Libyan Authority for Scientific Research - Head of the National Program for Enhancing the International Competitiveness of Libyan Universities - Head of the Consultant Committee at the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research - Head of Affairs Office at the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research - Head of the Legal Office at  the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research  Libya is fully committed to aligning with UNESCO’s vision, recognizing the immense value and benefits that Open Science brings to both the Libyan academic and non-academic communities.    Moving forward, we are eager to accelerate our efforts in collaboration with UNESCO and international partners, ensuring that Open Science principles are embedded within Libya’s higher education, research, and knowledge-sharing ecosystem.
