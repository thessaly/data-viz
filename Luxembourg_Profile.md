Support of Open Science, as well as the anchoring of science in society with the goal of establishing Luxembourg as a leading knowledge-based society, is enshrined in the National Research and Innovation Strategy, adopted by Government in 2019. To advance towards the aim of making Luxembourg an economy based on data-driven science and innovation strategies hinges, access to data is crucial. Luxembourg has made significant progress on this front. The Luxembourgish Government’s Open Data Strategy (2022) emphasises data re-use and points to the National Data Portal, data.public.lu launched in 2016, as (1) the central syndicate of various national thematic data portals, including those on geospatial data, statistics, mobility, meteorological and environmental data, and (2) as the connection to the European Open Data Portal. In the multi-annual performance agreements (currently for the period 2022-2025) signed between the State and the public research institutions in Luxembourg, the latter commit to implementing a national Open Access policy.  The University of Luxembourg’s library, the Luxembourg Learning Centre, has had a dedicated post for scholarly communication and open science since 2012, when the institutional repository ORBilu was launched. The role aims to support the needs of researchers in scholarly communication throughout the research cycle through information, training and policy making.

## B2 – Open Science Policies and Governance

### B2.1 — Share a machine-readable PDF file of the policy

National Research and Innovation Strategy: https://mesr.gouvernement.lu/en/publications/2020/national-research-and-innovation-strategy.html, Ministry of Higher Education and Research, adoption by Government in 12/2019, publication early 2020

### B2.2 — Please share a machine-readable PDF file(s) of the policy(ies) and provide the following information for each: Title of the policy or legal instrument, the authority in charge of development of the policy, entities involved and the process of development, year of adoption, year of last update, key areas/sections of the policy, elements of open science that are addressed, and links to the webpage(s) if available

A National Open Access Policy was adopted in 2015. The National Research Fund FNR has an Open Access Policy, which is fully aligned with the 2021 Recommendation on Open Science and strongly encourages Open Access Publishing. The Policy was revised in January 2025 due to concerns regarding the high costs related to Open Access publishing. While Open Access publishing was previously mandatory for publications resulting from FNR funded projects, FNR has aligned its policy to the ones of research-performing institutions and does not impose an Open Access obligation where this is not a requirement by the institution the concerned researcher is affiliated to. Relevant documents can be found under the following link: https://www.fnr.lu/open-science/

### B2.3 — Please provide details and links as relevant, including for each instrument: Title of the instrument, its objective, the authority in charge, allocated budget, elements of open science included

In the framework of its aforementioned Open Access Policy, the FNR has set up an Open Access Fund to promote the free access to research results from FNR-(co)funded projects by providing financial support to help cover article processing charges.  FNR also requires a Data  Management Plan (DMP) to be drafted for all projects accepted for funding and has set up related guidelines and templates.  In the framework of its missions, the FNR also implements Science in Society activities and events aiming at anchoring science in society and promoting science in school and among the public.

### B2.4 — Please provide details and links as relevant, including the name of ministries and national authorities/entities, as well as affiliated organizations that are involved in the development and implementation of the plan, strategy or the roadmap

and participatory  science, or co-production of knowledge with multiple actors).

FNR conducts numerous Science in Society activities with the aim of anchoring science in society and fostering societal impact.  The University of Luxembourg has introduced the ORBilu deposit mandate in 2012, which enforces the University’s commitment to the open access agenda when it comes to research output. It is mandatory for researchers to deposit scientific peer reviewed articles and published conference proceedings as open access. It also encourages researchers to deposit their selected research output of any type, e.g. if possible open access or at least with a comprehensive metadata record of the reference.  The University of Luxembourg has also joined the Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment. Its CoARA action plan includes streamlining of open science practice, supporting the use of ORBilu for ensuring that research output is archived, preserved and visible by the ‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary’ approach and supporting ‘science for society’ initiatives through outreach and other citizen science efforts, via the mandated Citizen Science group and DESCOM in particular.

### B2.6 — Please provide details and links as relevant

As previously mentioned, FNR has set up the FNR Open Access Fund which provides financial support to help cover article processing charges for FNR-funded projects. As part of consortium licences to which public research institutions and the National Library of Luxembourg belong, transformative agreements with different publishers have been concluded. Moreover, the National Library of Luxembourg has launched a study in January 2025 to analyse the feasibility of a new national scientific collection at the National Library, bringing together all scientific publications. This study is funded by the FNR. The FNR PSP (Promoting Science to the Public) funding programme aims to bring science closer to society and funds projects that allow the target audience to come into contact with science and research interactively.  The FNR RESCOM funding programme aims to support communication in view of disseminating and exchanging scientific outcomes.

### B2.7 — Please provide details and links as relevant
