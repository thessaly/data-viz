### B2.3: Specific policy instruments promoting open science
The main policy instrument is the Action plan for Open Science.  The Slovenian Research and Innovation Agency, the main funder of Slovenian science, includes open science requirements in its calls for proposals in accordance with the 2021 Act. Besides there are the regular annual calls for proposals for scientific journals and monographs where the journal or book need to be in immediate open access. Additionally, the SPOZNAJ (2023-2026) introduces open science principles to Slovenian public research organisations.

### B2.4: National implementation plan / roadmap
Since all EU/ERA recommendations and policies in the field of open science were developed in alignment with the UNESCO recommendations and are fully consistent with them, all Slovenian national documents that were prepared by the Ministry for Higher Education, Science and Innovation are also in line with the listed UNESCO recommendations (details are under item 2.1 of this document).

### B2.5: Institutional open science policies
First, the institutional implementation of the principles of open science in the activities of public research organisations takes place through the Open Science Action Plan (https://www.gov.si/assets/ministrstva/MVZI/Znanost/Nacionalne-strategije-in-dokumenti/2023-Action-Plan-Open-Science-Slovenia.pdf) , which introduces a set of integrated infrastructures and activities that support the adaptation of research organisations to operate according to open science principles, ranging from the provision of open science infrastructure and open science monitoring to the provision of skills and competences. Second, the project SPOZNAJ (2023-2026) (https://projekt-spoznaj.si), which is funded by the Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Innovation and the European Union – NextGenerationEU, aims to integrate the principles of open science into scientific research practices and to align the operations of twenty public research organisations and the Central Technical Library at the University of Ljubljana with these principles. In particular, Work Package 6 of the SPOZNAJ project is dedicated to the comprehensive adjustment of consortium partners' operations in accordance with the open science principles and evaluation of the results. It is divided into the following subsets: Subset 6.1 Analysis of business/organizational models of support structures to facilitate operations in accordance with open science principles, tailored to the specific needs of individual consortium partners and providing recommendations based on the findings. The project partners will analyze their organization's situation regarding research data management and legal, ethical, and other aspects related to open science. Subset 6.2 Plan for operational adjustments in accordance with open science principles and piloting the implementation of the most significant adjustments. In the analysis, the project partners will identify necessary changes to internal legal acts and organizational structures required to enforce open science principles. They will also assess the presence of suitable infrastructures and their integration. Subset 6.3 Preparation of internal organizational regulations, documents, and policies for the final recipients. The project partners will incorporate provisions on open science into their internal regulations, which govern the implementation of stable funding for research activities. Subset 6.4 Making adjustments. Simultaneously with the preparation of legal acts outlined in subset 6.4, the project partners will undertake organizational, personnel, and infrastructural adaptations of work processes, technologies, digital repositories, and libraries. Subset 6.5: Evaluation of project results. The project partners will verify the achievement of the planned project goals through an evaluation process that will consider the requirements of the public tender and the established objectives. Additionally, at the University of Ljubljana open science is supported by the Statutes of UL,  (http://pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=STAT233) Art. 6 and 133, Rules on stable funding of UL scientific research activities (https://www.uni-lj.si/assets/Pravni-akti/Raziskovalno-razvojno-delo-in-intelektualna-lastnina/Trenutno-veljavni-akti-UL/Raziskovalno-in-razvojno-delo/Pravilnik-o-stabilnem-financiranju-znanstvenoraziskovalne-dejavnosti-UL-neuradno-precisceno-besedilo-velja-od-6.4.2024.pdf) , Art. 25 and 26, Rules on doctoral studies at UL (https://www.uni-lj.si/assets/Sluzba-za-doktorski-studij/Pravila-in-postopki/Pravilnik-o-doktorskem-studiju-neuradno-precisceno-besedilo-z-dne-27.-4.-2024.pdf) , mostly Art. 50, Strategy of UL 2022-2027 (https://www.uni-lj.si/assets/Sluzba-za-spremljanje-kakovosti-analize-in-porocanje/Strategija-UL-2022-2027.pdf), Item 7.2, performance indicator RP2-K6m, and Digital strategy of UL 2024-2027 (https://www.uni-lj.si/assets/Kabinet/1_Strategije-UL/08._Digitalna_strategija_UL_2024-2027.pdf), Goal Research R.2 and activity 2.

### B2.8: Public-private partnerships for open science
/

### B2.9: National monitoring framework for open science
We are performing the monitoring for open science by two mechanisms.  The first mechanism are annual work plans and annual reports of publicly funded research organisations (we have 22 publicly funded research organisations in Slovenia). In these documents they are, besides other things, planning and reporting (mostly in a narrative way) their progress in aligning operations towards open science principles as stated in Resolution on the Slovenian Scientific Research and Innovation Strategy 2030, Decree on the implementation of scientific research work in accordance with the principles of open science (https://www.gov.si/assets/ministrstva/MIZS/Dokumenti/ZNANOST/Nacionalni-dokumenti/Resolution-on-the-Slovenian-Scientific-Research-and-Innovation-Strategy-2030) and pertaining Action plan for Open (https://www.gov.si/assets/ministrstva/MVZI/Znanost/Nacionalne-strategije-in-dokumenti/2023-Action-Plan-Open-Science-Slovenia.pdf)  Science. In doing so they are supported by a SPOZNAJ (2023-2026)  (https://projekt-spoznaj.si) project.  The second mechanism is a national open science monitor which displays numerical data of the level of openness of different research results in digital form. It is currently being piloted (https://monitor.openscience.si/). The data for the national monitor is mainly based on data from the national research information system SICRIS, the national bibliographic system COBISS, the Slovenian Open Science Infrastructure and the national Open Data Portal. In the future, we intend to improve the quality of the data by adding data from some international data sources such as Crossref, Open Alex, Datacite, Directory of Open Access Journals, etc. We expect the Slovenian Open Science Monitor to be fully operational in the second half of 2025.

Moreover, the Slovenian Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (NAKVIS https://nakvis.si/) and the Slovenian Research and Innovation Agency (ARIS https://www.aris-rs.si/sl/agencija/vizitka.asp) have aligned minimal standards for election to the titles of higher education teachers and researchers with principles of open science (NAKVIS: Minimalni standardi za izvolitev v nazive visokošolskih učiteljev, znanstvenih delavcev in visokošolskih sodelavcev na visokošolskih zavodih, ARIS: Splošni akt o raziskovalnih nazivih https://pisrs.si/pregledPredpisa?id=DRUG3538). Public universities and research institutes are obliged by the Decree on the implementation of scientific research work in accordance with the principles of open science https://www.gov.si/assets/ministrstva/MVZI/Znanost/Obzorje-Evropa/Novice/2023-Open-Science/Decree-on-the-implementation-of-scientific-research-work-open-science.pdf (Arts. 10, 11, 17) to align assessment with open science principles. By doing so, they are supported by the SPOZNAJ project http://projekt-spoznaj.si/en/.

### B5.2: Open science practices in career evaluation
One of the Slovenian signatories to CoARA (as well as DORA) is the Slovenian Research and Innovation Agency, the main funder of Slovenian science, which has announced that it will begin a complete overhaul of its evaluation system https://www.aris-rs.si/sl/akti/24/prav-razisk-nazivi-dec24.asp in May 2026. However, some institutions, such as the two largest Slovenian universities, the University of Ljubljana and the University of Maribor, have already started to change their assessment procedures in 2024 and have also organised several consultations on changes to the evaluation system.

### B5.3: Initiatives to recognise/reward open science practices
Open science has only recently been included in the legal regulations in Slovenia. Within Measure 6.2.2/4 of the Action Plan for Open Science https://www.gov.si/assets/ministrstva/MVZI/Znanost/Nacionalne-strategije-in-dokumenti/2023-Action-Plan-Open-Science-Slovenia.pdf there are plans to introduce Incentives for Engagement in Open Science in the form of (1) amending internal regulations of JRO regarding the evaluation and assessment of researchers and (2) support for early-career researchers to encourage engagement in open science, including establishing a scheme to identify and recognize early-career researchers who have achieved notable results in the field of Open Science.

### B5.4: Challenges and additional observations
The negative effects can be reduced to a common denominator: The transition to open science is a technically and financially demanding endeavour that requires significant additional resources and efforts including cultural change. These factors are slowing down the changes.

## B6: Societal Engagement & Open Innovation

### B6.1: Innovative participatory / societal engagement practices
promotion of pre-prints;exploration of open peer-review practices; valuing and sharing of negative scientific results and associated data;participatory methods that value inputs from societal actors, e.g. citizen science, crowdsourcing scientific projects;development of participatory strategies for identifying the needs of marginalized communities and highlighting socially relevant issues to be incorporated into research agendas

The Citizen Science Network https://citizenscience.si/ is an active network in Slovenia that supports citizen science research and contributes to raising scientific literacy. The network currently has 55 members, ranging from universities to research institutions, NGOs and individuals. The network's catalogue currently includes 72 citizen science projects. In Slovenia, a strategic document Communicating Science in Slovenia https://www.gov.si/novice/2024-08-02-komuniciranje-znanosti-v-sloveniji/ has been adopted in 2024,  which defines key guidelines and activities in this field in Slovenia.

## B7: International Cooperation

### B7.1: Promoting international scientific collaborations on open science
/

### B7.2: Cross-border multi-stakeholder collaboration strategy
The formal basis that supports international collaboration in open science is the Resolution on the Slovenian Scientific Research and Innovation Strategy 2030 (ReZrIS30)  https://www.gov.si/assets/ministrstva/MIZS/Dokumenti/ZNANOST/Nacionalni-dokumenti/Resolution-on-the-Slovenian-Scientific-Research-and-Innovation-Strategy-2030 containing Measure 6.2.1. that the national Open Science ecosystem must be coherent with international practices and the national open science structures and infrastructures are integrated into international networks and infrastructures. Additional national document that supports international collaboration in open science is Strategy for the internationalization of higher education and science in the Republic of Slovenia until 2030  https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.si%2Fassets%2Fministrstva%2FMVZI%2FVisoko-solstvo%2FDokumenti-VS%2FStrategija-internacionalizacije-VS-in-znanosti-2023.docx&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK.  Slovenia is promoting international collaboration on open science by supporting participation in international organisations, associations, forums and events. As for example “open science monitoring” including OSMI initiative https://open-science-monitoring.org/, RDA where we are financing operation of Slovenian RDA node https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/rda-slovenia/activity/, besides, we are active in EOSC Association https://eosc.eu/members/ with several delegates as well as in CoNOSC https://conosc.org/membership/. Besides, we have nominated national European Research Area Policy Agendahttps://commission.europa.eu/system/files/2021-11/ec_rtd_era-policy-agenda-2021.pdf  persons for open science actions (ERA action 1, ERA action 2 and ERA action 3). There are several other international and EU projects and activities that support open science with participants from Slovenija (CoARA https://coara.eu/agreement/signatories/?category%5B0%5D=slovenia#signatories,  Knowledge Rights 21 https://www.knowledgerights21.org/, OPERAS https://operas-eu.org/, PALOMERA https://operas-eu.org/projects/palomera/, Mutual Learning Exercise on Research Careers https://projects.research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/en/statistics/policy-support-facility/mutual-learning-exercise-research-careers, European Citizen Science Association https://www.ecsa.ngo/ etc.).

### B7.3: Regional/international funding mechanisms for open science
Slovenia is actively involved in the operation and development of the European Open Science Cloud Eosc, which supports open science at European Union level.  Slovenia is also actively involved in the formation of policies to support the open science within the Eurospean Research Area.
