### B4.3 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so.

The open science competencies have not been incorporated into higher education and research skills curricula because of low awareness of open science and restrictions of the state of war. But, the Ministry of Education and Science has developed methodological recommendations on scientific data management for higher education institutions and scientific institutions in terms of determining mechanisms for preserving and reusing scientific data https://mon.gov.ua/nauka/nauka-2/vidkrita-nauka/informatsiino-metodychni-materialy

### B4.5 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so.

## B5 – Research Assessment and Incentives

### B5.1 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so.

The Ministry of Education and Science did not receive such proposals.

### B5.2 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so.

Specific clauses that recognize open science practices, including sharing, collaborating and engaging with other researchers and societal actors beyond the scientific community, or dialogue with other knowledge systems, has not been incorporated in the career evaluation and progression systems.

### B5.3 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so.

The lack of infrastructure for open science (repositories of data) makes it impossible to introduce recognition and rewards.

## B6 – Engagement of Societal Actors & Open Innovation

### B6.1 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so.

These initiatives are absent because the current level of implementation of open science practices is low.

---

## B7 – International Cooperation

### B7.1 — How is your country promoting and facilitating international scientific collaborations on open science as outlined in the 2021 Recommendation on Open Science?

International scientific collaborations on open science are not promoted and facilitated in Ukraine. The reason is lack of available resources in the state of war. But the state, represented by the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine, actively participates in grant programs to promote the principles of Open Science, in particular, in the Horizon Europe program.

### B7.2 — If possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so.

The country does not have a strategy or a plan for stimulating cross-border multi-stakeholder collaboration on open science. This documents might be developed after the war ends.

### B7.3 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

Projects Open4UA https://lpnu.ua/en/open4ua and OPTIMA https://lpnu.ua/en/optima

## B8 – Other

### B9 — Any other comments

We are interested in implementing a national project to implement open science practices, which will involve at least one representative from each higher education institution and research institutions. The Russian Federation's ongoing military aggression significantly limits the country's financial resources and hinders planning. For example, it is impossible to choose a location for e-infrastructure that will be completely protected from possible destruction due to bombing or missile attacks.
