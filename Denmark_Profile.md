## B1: Promotion of the UNESCO 2021 Recommendation

### B1.1: Promotion to ministries and national authorities
The Danish Agency for Higher
Education and Science is an agency in the Ministry of Higher Education and Science and
handles tasks within preparation and administration of grants for research, higher
education, and research-based innovation, as well as the State Educational Grant and
Loan Scheme

### B1.2: Translation into national language(s)
There are no obstacles to
promote the recommendation. The Agency for Higher Education plans to promote
the recommendation via the Agency´s website on Open Access/FAIR data in 2025.

### B1.3: Awareness-raising activities organised
In connection with the Ministry of Higher Education and Science's evaluation of
Denmark's National Strategy for Open Access, a conference was held on
November 1, 2023, with the participation of senior management from Danish
research institutions, including universities, university colleges, higher education
institutions within the fine arts, other research organizations, as well as public and
private foundations. In addition to discussing the implementation of the strategy's
goals and recommendations for its revision, the EU Commission gave a
presentation on Open Science, including, among other topics, the value of FAIR
data.
Furthermore, Denmark, DeiC (Danish e-infrastructure Consortium), is member of
the European partnership Knowledge Exchange. Established in 2005, it is a
collaboration between six national key organisations in Europe. The purpose is to
develop infrastructures and services to enable Open Science for the benefit of
research and higher education. Knowledge Exchange outputs have been
disseminated to the Danish universities and other relevant stakeholders. Links available.

## B2: Open Science Policies & Governance

### B2.1: National STI policy with open science elements
It is not due to barriers or obstacles as such. Rather, the reason is that the Ministry
of Higher Education and Science has chosen to prioritise specific elements of Open
Science, including Open Access, FAIR research data, and research integrity, as
outlined in Section 2.2

### B2.2: National policies/legal frameworks aligned with Recommendation
The Danish Ministry of Higher Education focuses on three key elements of Open
Science but does not have a national Open Science strategy. The key elements
are:
• Open Access to scientific peer-reviewed publications – Denmark’s
National Strategy for Open Access (2014)
• FAIR research data – National strategy for data management based on
the FAIR principles (2021)
• Research Integrity: Danish Code of Conduct for Research Integrity (2014)
Denmark’s National Strategy for Open Access aims to provide Open Access to all
scientific publications from Danish universities in 2025. Every year, the Danish
Open Access Indicator monitors the progress of Open Access at Danish
universities. 2024 monitoring shows that 75 per cent of Danish scientific articles
from Danish universities were Open Access. The National Strategy for Open
Access was evaluated in 2023-2024. The evaluation shows that the number of
scientific articles from Danish universities made freely available online has
inceased. However, the strategy’s aim of 100% by 2025 is unlikely to be reached
due to barriers such as embargo periods and journal restrictions.
National stakeholders such as universities and other research institutions have
started implementing the National Strategy for Data Management based on FAIR
principles in 2022. Furthermore, a working group of national stakeholders,
recently set up by the Danish Ministry of Higher Education and Science, will
coordinate measures that require national coordination and monitor the progress
of the implementation.
Finally, the Ministry of Higher Education and Science has established a
committee tasked with updating the Danish Code of Conduct for Research
Integrity (2014) to reflect developments in Open Science among other things,
including guidelines for data management based on FAIR principles, Open
Access, and Citizen Science, cf. paragraph 1.4.

### B2.3: Specific policy instruments promoting open science
Beyond the strategies mentioned in section 2.2., the Ministry of Higher Education
and Science has no plans or strategies as mentioned in section 2.3.

### B2.4: National implementation plan / roadmap
At the institutional level, the eight Danish universities have institutional Open
Access and Data Management/FAIR Data policies. Some universities have
guidelines regarding Citizen Science. Examples are listed below:
Aarhus University (AU)
At Aarhus University Open Science is addressed in several ways. At the policy
level there is an Open Science Committee consisting of a dean (as the chair
person), all the vice deans of research, and the vice director of AU Research
support. This committee refers directly to the university management and is
responsible for the development of all Open Science policies of the university:
(https://medarbejdere.au.dk/en/strategy/the-open-science-comittee). Below this
Committee, Aarhus University has a Research Data Management policy which
addresses a number of Open Science issues:
https://medarbejdere.au.dk/en/research-data-management , as well as an Open
Access Policy: (https://medarbejdere.au.dk/en/open-access). Moreover, Aarhus
University also has a Citizen Science hub to enable knowledge exchange,
networking, and collaborations in relation to citizen science:
(https://projects.au.dk/citsci)
University of Southern Denmark (SDU)
The SDU Open Science Policy was revised in 2024. The policy is concentrated
around FAIR Data and Data Management, Open Access to publications, CoARA,
and Citizen Science.
Link to policy: https://sdunet.dk/en/research/research-data-management-
support/the-sdu-open-science-policy
Aalborg University (AAU)
AAU has an updated Open Access policy approved in 2024 and in effect from
January 2025: (https://www.staff.aau.dk/rules/research/open-access-policy-of-
aalborg-university).
AAU also has a datamanagement policy:
(https://www.staff.aau.dk/rules/research/policy-for-research-data-management)
The updated Open Access policy supports AAU’s new Research and Innovation
indicator, which is CoARA compliant and operates actively with Open Science
through a focus on Collaboration, Visibility, and Openness. See:
https://www.researcher.aau.dk/guides/aau-research-indicator and
https://vbn.aau.dk/en/projects/konstruktion-af-forskningsindikator-til-aau
AAU has a new Competence unit and Diamond Publishing platform (AAU
OPEN): (https://www.aau.dk/forskning/open-publishing?marketing=open.aau.dk)
Technical University of Denmark (DTU)
DTU has developed a Policy for research data management
(https://www.bibliotek.dtu.dk/-
/media/andre_universitetsenheder/bibliotek/bibliotek_newdesign/politikker/dtu-
research-data-management-policy.pdf) aligned with the National Strategy for
datamanagement based on the FAIR principles
(https://www.deic.dk/sites/default/files/documents/PDF/EN_National%20strategi
%20for%20data%20management%20baseret%20p%C3%A5%20FAIR-
principper.pdf).
Perspectives on Opens Access to research outputs are outlined in the DTU
Research Publication Policy: (https://www.dtu.dk/-
/media/andre_universitetsenheder/bibliotek/Bibliotek_newdesign/politikker/dtu_pu
blication_policy.pdf).
Copenhagen Business School (CBS)
CBS has an Open Access Policy (2019) and Open Access guidelines:
(https://www.cbs.dk/files/cbs.dk/call_to_action/cbs_open_access_policy_2019.pd
f).
Furthermore, CBS is currently revising its Research Data Management policy from
2017 (https://www.cbs.dk/files/cbs.dk/call_to_action/cbs_rdm_policy.pdf), which
states the following: “Copenhagen Business School (CBS) envisions itself as a
“world-leading business university” that contributes to society with academically
excellent research and research-based education. Academic excellence
presupposes trustworthiness and high integrity, i.e. honesty, transparency, and
accountability of research, as stated in the Danish Code of Conduct for Research
Integrity. Research data management ensures honest, transparent, and
accountable research practices. Therefore, CBS encourages researchers to
manage their data according to the FAIR-principles, thus making them findable,
accessible, interoperable, and reusable. CBS and the individual researchers share
responsibilities to comply with the principles of responsible and FAIR research data
management outlined in this policy. The policy specifies in more detail the
obligations of both the institution and the researchers. (§1.1 Purpose)”
Public Foundations
The three public research foundations (Independent Research Fund Denmark,
Innovation Fund Denmark and the Danish National Research Foundation) have a
joint Open Access policy, which is aligned with the national Open Access policy.:
(https://ufm.dk/en/research-and-innovation/cooperation-between-research-and-
innovation/open-access/Publications/councils-and-foundations)
Universities
Furtermore, Universities Denmark (the organisation of the eight Danish Universties)
has developed a framework for the recognition of knowledge dissemination, which
includes guidance on how open science practices can be recognized:
(https://dkuni.dk/wp-
content/uploads/2024/06/dkuni_advancing_competencies_and_experiences_with
in_impact.pdf)

### B2.5: Institutional open science policies
The Ministry of Higher Education and Science provide funds for a national Open
Access Indicator, which monitors the annual progress in Open Access in
Denmark, cf. Denmarks National Strategy on Open Access.
Link: The Danish Open Access Indicator: https://oaindikator.dk/en/
Furthermore, DeIC (Danish e-infrastructure cooperation) invests in European
Open Science Cloud (EOSC). The EOSC is recognised by the Council of the
European Union among the 20 actions of the policy agenda 2022-2024 of the
European Research Area (ERA) with the specific objective to deepen open
science practices in Europe. It is also recognised as the "science, research and
innovation data space" which will be fully articulated with the other sectoral data
spaces defined in the European strategy for data.
Link: https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/strategy/strategy-research-
and-innovation/our-digital-future/open-science/european-open-science-cloud-
eosc_en

### B2.6: National funding mechanisms for open science
The Danish National Research Foundation has introduced various FAIR-related
requirements for grant recipients. The foundation regularly approves dedicated
data managers (and actively encourages this). Furthermore, Innovation Fund
Denmark requires a DMP (Data Mangement Plan) for some of its instruments and
funds grant recipients' expenses for Open Access publishing (within reasonable
limits)

### B2.8: Public-private partnerships for open science
ODIN – an Open Innovation in Science (OIS) platform
For half a decade, Aarhus University has experimented with use-inspired, patent-
free, and precompetitive industry collaborations in order to accelerate discoveries
and make them easier for industry to translate into innovation. ODIN is an Open
Innovation in Science (OIS) platform where industry and academia co-create open
research projects relevant for drug discovery and diagnostics. The platform was
established by five different universities together with a range of Danish and
international companies within pharma and biotech.
OIS platforms foster open and patent-free public-private R&D partnerships in the
form of co-created research projects between university researchers and
companies. No one can take out patents or other forms of intellectual property
rights on the open outputs of OIS platforms. However, anyone can use them for
commercial purposes downstream. All research at the platforms must be
precompetitive (TRL 1-3) – but also highly use-inspired.
Link: Open ODIN: https://projects.au.dk/open-odin

### B2.9: National monitoring framework for open science
The Ministry of Higher Education and Science operates a national Open Access
Indicator, which monitors the annual progress in Open Access in Denmark, cf.
Denmarks National Strategy on Open Access.
Link: The Danish Open Access Indicator: https://oaindikator.dk/en/

## B3: Infrastructure

### B3.1: R&D expenditure as % of GDP
In 2022, Denmark’s total R&D expenditure was estimated to 2,89 pct. of GDP, of
which 1,11 pct. of GDP was performed in the public sector and 1,78 pct. of GDP
was performed in the private sector. Compiled by Statistics Denmark as of the
beginning of 2024

### B3.2: Population with access to reliable internet
In 2024, 97 pct. of the Danish households had access to the internet. Compiled by
Statistics Denmark 2024

### B3.3: National Research and Education Network (NREN)
The responsibility as a Danish NREN is lifted in collaboration between DeiC
Forskningsnettet (The Danish Research Network)
https://www.deic.dk/en/research-network) and DeiC (Danish e-Infrastructure
Consortium).
All open science actors have access to the national research network.

### B3.5: Participation in federated international infrastructure
Denmark contributes to the development of the European Open Science Cloud
(EOSC) via the implementation of the National strategy for data management
based on the FAIR principles (2021), cf. paragraph 2.2.
Furthermore, DeIC (Danish e-Infrastructure Cooperation) is currently exploring the
possibilities of establishing a Danish or Nordic EOSC node that can be federated
with the EOSC EU node as well as other national and thematic nodes in other EU
member states.

### B3.6: North-South / South-South infrastructure collaborations
Denmark is a member of the EU and a number of international research
infrastructures (e.g. CERN, ESO, EMBL, ESRF, European XFEL, and ESS). Via
those memberships, there are world-leading collaborations on research
infrastructures and research with stakeholders in countries from Latin America,
Africa, and Asia. The EU as well as all facilites work to promote open science and
open access to FAIR data.

## B4: Education, Capacity Building & Science Communication

### B4.1: Systematic capacity building on open science
Capacity building has been focused on ensuring national infrastructure is in place
that makes access possible to research data, primarily DeiC Dataverse
(https://dataverse.deic.dk/). Furthermore, efforts have been pushed to increase the
uptake of Persistent Identifiers for researchers, research data, instruments and
more. The Danish universities supports Open Science capacity building with
varying amounts of resources and engagement.
In 2025, AAU is launching its Open Science Community Aalborg, which is part of
the Skills4EOSC initiative OSC. In Copenhagen, CBS is leading Open Science
Community Copenhagen.

### B4.3: Open science competencies in higher education curricula
A framework of open science competencies at a national level is being discussed
nationally and by the DeiC board. Support for Open Science competencies is to a
varying degree already incorporated locally at the universities into higher education
research skills curricula.
National discussions take their point of departure in the National strategy for data
management based on the FAIR principles (2021) and The Strategic Research &
Innovation Agenda and its Multi-Annual Roadmap (https://eosc.eu/sria-mar/) and
specifically in the EOSC project Skills4EOSC (https://www.skills4eosc.eu/).

### B4.5: Science communication initiatives
The Danish Science Festival is an annual week-long festival that creates meeting
points between researchers and citizens. It takes place in April. The festival is
comprised of more then 700 lectures and events around the country. The festival
attract around 70,000 visitors every year.

## B5: Research Assessment & Incentives

### B5.1: Review of research assessment processes
Universities Denmark (the organisation of the eight Danish Universties) has
developed a framework for the recognition of knowledge dissemination, which
includes guidance on how open science practices can be recognized, cf.
paragraph 2.4.
Link:https://dkuni.dk/wpcontent/uploads/2024/06/dkuni_advancing_competencies
_and_experiences_within_impact.pdf
Furthermore, 1 university college, 7 (out of 8) universities, 3 private research
foundations and 2 (out of 3) public research foundations have signed the
Agreement on Reforming Research Assessment (ARRA) and thus joined the
Coalition on Reforming Research Assessment (CoARA). The Coalition for
Advancing Research Assessment (CoARA) is a collective of organisations
committed to reforming the methods and processes by which research,
researchers, and research organisations are evaluated.

The agreement on Reforming Research Assessment:
https://coara.eu/agreement/the-agreement-full-text/
Aalborg University
In 2022, AAU developed an institutional research and innovation indicator, which
is inspired by CoARA principles and is compliant with ARRA. The indicator is
used to allocate funding to the departments and is a lever to work actively with
Open Science elements within the overall themes of Collaboration, Visibility, and
Openness. The indicator promotes diversity in outputs, and research roles as well
as applying responsible methods in the analyses of quantitative and qualitative
data.
https://www.researcher.aau.dk/guides/aau-research-indicator
Public Research Foundations
One of the public research funds: Independent Research Fund Denmark
launched the Fund Strategy 2024-2026: "Independent Research in a World of
Change" in the fall of 2024. It includes, among other things, a departure from
evaluating researchers solely based on where and how much they have
published. This also marks a shift away from researchers’ dependency on the
powerful scientific publishing houses.
The fund is committed to CoARA, and it works on broader research
assessments, for example, by recognizing when researchers contribute valuable
datasets and make them accessible to others. The Danish Independent
Research Fund has laid out an action plan for 2024-2027, which aims to pave the
way for new assessment criteria, where publishing in high-profile journals no
longer carries as much weight.
The action plan aims, among other things, to establish a Danish CoARA network,
develop a new CV format that allows recognition of diverse roles and career paths,
and introduce a new format for publication lists that prioritizes quality and relevance
over quantity.

### B5.2: Open science practices in career evaluation
Please see answers in paragraph 2.4 (Universities Denmark´s framework for the
recognition of knowledge dissemination) and 2.6 (ODIN – an Open Innovation in
Science (OIS) Platform)

### B5.3: Initiatives to recognise/reward open science practices
Please, see answers in paragraph 1.4 (Uddate of the Danish Code of Conduct for
research Integrity, paragraph 2.4 (Universities Denmark´s framework for the
recognition of knowledge dissemination) and 2.6 (ODIN – an Open Innovation in
Science (OIS) Platform) and paragraph 5.1.( Agreement on Reforming Research
Assessment (ARRA) and thus joined the Coalition on Reforming Research
Assessment (CoARA)).

### B5.4: Challenges and additional observations
Denmarks Nationalt Open Access Strategy states : « It is crucial for research and
from a socio-economic perspective, that the aggregate public expenditure for
scientific publication does not increase significantly as a result of the
implementation of Open Access »
Link : Denmark´s National Open Access Strategy page 2:
https://ufm.dk/en/research-and-innovation/cooperation-between-research-and-
innovation/open-access/Publications/denmarks-national-strategy-for-open-
access/national-strategy-for-open-access-english.pdf
According to a recent evaluation of the strategy, the strategy has not succeeded
in keeping the estimated publication expenses stable in line with its
recommendations. The total estimated publication costs have increased. While
expenses for licenses have been kept relatively stable, the costs of Open Access
publishing with APC (Article Processing Charges), primarily in gold open-access
journals, have risen significantly. This increase cannot be solely attributed to an
increase in publication volume. This means that Danish universities are
increasingly paying for Open Access publishing, either directly or through their
Danish or international co-authors.

## B8: Other / Additional Comments

### B8.1: Additional observations on open science implementation
According to the Danish National Commission for UNESCO Open Science
aims to make research freely accessible, but its implementation faces challenges.
The current publishing system favors established journals with high fees, making
Open Access costly for researchers with limited funding. Sharing research data is
also complex—quantitative data is easier to share, but qualitative data raises
ethical concerns and risks misinterpretation. Additionally, language barriers persist,
as English dominates scientific discourse, potentially excluding local communities.
To ensure fairness, Open Science should adopt flexible funding models, ethical
guidelines for data sharing, and strategies to address linguistic inequalities.
The Ministry of Higher Education and Science agrees that these structural
issues are relevant. However, the Ministry would like to draw attention to the fact
that Denmark´s National Strategy for Open Access is fundamentally based on a
Green Open Access model, where researchers make their articles Open Access
by self-archiving them in a digital repository accessible to all. This is free (apart
from administrative costs), meaning that researchers do not have to pay a fee to
the journal to make their article Open Access. However, the costs of Open Access
with APC (Article Processing Charges) payments have still increased significantly
in Denmark, cf. section 5.4, despite the strategy's option to achieve Open Access
through self-archiving in a repository (green Open Access).
Regarding the sharing of qualitative data, Open Science, including the FAIR
principles, does not require all data to be open. If a researcher determines that
certain data should remain closed—e.g., because they cannot be anonymized or
if data should not be shared for confidentiality or security reasons—it is possible to
keep them closed, following the principle: "as open as possible, as closed as
necessary."
Finally, concerning the issue of English dominating scientific discourse, the
Ministry can point out that it has, in a initial phase (2017-2019), supported Danish
scientific journals in their transition to digital formats on the condition that they
make their articles Open Access, potentially after an embargo period, cf.
Tidskrift.dk (section 3.4)
