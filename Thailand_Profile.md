Policy Innovation Platform for the Better Future (PIP) is a central platform that opens for brainstorming and crowdsourcing. The aim is to bridge the gap between policymakers and people in the policymaking process to effectively tackle disruptive problems, e.g. the impact of COVID-19 and the effects of learning loss in higher education. It provides opportunities for the public to participate in policymaking process to obtain new policy innovations and creates a network for those that are ready to bring the policy into actions after their policies have been selected. Utilizing a prize or competition-based model to incentivize new policy ideas, PIP creates the window of opportunity for the public agencies, innovators and stakeholders to co-create policy solutions and overcomes traditional silos of policymaking process. Allocated budget for PIP is 1,000,000 THB/year.  Thailand Higher Education and Innovation Policy Accelerator (THIPA) is an innovation policy platform aimed at accelerating the policy-making process in an organization in order to respond to changes and uncertainties in a timely manner. The platform is set up to assist other organizations to design appropriate policies that can drive innovation in government, academia, businesses, and society, using the best available tools for both analysis and action. THIPA works on inter-agency projects that involve higher education, science, research and innovation policy and have a scale-up potential to make a big impact on society. Proposals are subject to a readiness assessment prior to proceeding. Allocated budget for THIPA is 4,000,000 THB/year  While PIP is a platform that identifies issues corresponding to the public’s needs, THIPA turns the policy into action through engagement with stakeholders. In order to address the unmet needs, during a policy design process, THIPA brings together policymakers and stakeholders to co-develop new solutions. The design thinking tools and process are employed to address the challenges in policy implementation, and expected to reach a suitable and actionable policy for all parties involved.
