### B2.2 — Please share a machine-readable PDF file(s) of the policy(ies) and provide the following information for each: Title of the policy or legal instrument, the authority in charge of development of the policy, entities involved and the process of development, year of adoption, year of last update, key areas/sections of the policy, elements of open science that are addressed, and links to the webpage(s) if available

Qatar has several policies, strategies, and initiatives that address key elements of open science, aligning with the 2021 UNESCO Recommendation. The principles and key elements of open science, as outlined in the 2021 UNESCO Recommendation, are increasingly being addressed and integrated within the nation's broader research and innovation ecosystem. This integration is primarily driven by strategic initiatives and policies championed by key national entities, aiming to foster a more transparent, collaborative, and accessible research environment. The following points will delve into how these existing frameworks and ongoing efforts align with the core tenets of the UNESCO Recommendation. SUB-POINT 16.a: There aren't detailed guidelines on how to ensure reciprocity and prevent inequitable extraction in the context of open science. However, the principles underlying 16(a) can be reflected in broader Qatari policies and practices. For example, Qatar's research funding bodies, like the QNRF, emphasize ethical research conduct. This includes respecting intellectual property rights and ensuring fair and equitable access to research benefits.  These ethical considerations help prevent the unfair extraction of data and knowledge. Furthermore, there are laws and regulations concerning data privacy and security in Qatar.  These regulations contribute to a framework where data sharing must be done responsibly and ethically. Finally, the Focus on National Development implies that any open science initiatives would need to serve Qatar's interests and wouldn't involve the unfair or inequitable extraction of its resources or knowledge. SUB-POINT 16.b: Although Qatar does not have a specific policy mandating that all publicly funded research outputs (publications, data, software, etc.) must follow open licensing or be dedicated to the public domain, there are several policies and practices that suggest a tendency toward these principles, albeit with some nuances. Qatar promotes open access to publicly funded research, notably through QNRF and QNL initiatives as follows: The Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF) encourages open access to research outputs from funded projects. While it is not always a mandatory requirement, it represents a significant initiative to make publicly funded research openly available. Its policies address intellectual property rights, often including provisions that allow researchers to retain certain rights while also facilitating public access to research findings. This indicates a trend towards open licensing, although it may not always be the default option. The Qatar National Library open access program offers researchers several ways to publish their work openly. This includes funding for article processing charges and a repository for archiving research. By providing these resources, the program facilitates open access to publications resulting from research, which may include projects that are publicly funded. SUB-POINT 16.c: Qatar's policies don't directly address "bibliodiversity" in the way described in UNESCO recommendation. There isn't a national policy specifically promoting diverse formats, community-driven publishing models, or prioritizing not-for-profit publishing. However, some elements contribute indirectly. The QNRF, along with universities such as Qatar University and Qatar Foundation, funds research in various disciplines. Although this funding does not specifically target publishing models, it supports the development of diverse research outputs. Furthermore, Qatar University Library (QUL) enhances access to a variety of publications and supports academic publishing by offering platforms like an institutional repository and an archive for open-access resources. Although it does not explicitly focus on bibliodiversity, QUL's services contribute to increasing access to diverse formats and types of knowledge. SUB-POINT 16.d: There is no specific national policy that highlights the importance of multilingualism in scientific publications or academic communications. However, multilingualism is present in Qatar's academic and research environment due to the use of Arabic and English as follows:  Arabic is the official language of Qatar and is promoted in education, government, and media. This emphasis extends to academic and scientific communication within the country. Qatar places a strong focus on education, including higher education and research, which fosters multilingualism. As a result, students and researchers are often exposed to English and other languages in their studies and professional activities. Consequently, many scientific publications from Qatari institutions are published in English. Additionally, Qatar's active participation in international research collaborations necessitates the use of multiple languages, particularly English, for scientific communication and publications. SUB-POINT 16.e: Qatar is a member of the United Nations and has likely endorsed the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. However, this general endorsement may does not result in specific national legislation or policies that directly address the intersection of indigenous rights and open science practices. Nevertheless, future global collaborations may tackle these issues. SUB-POINT 16.h: Qatar is actively developing a research and innovation ecosystem that brings together various stakeholders, including researchers, academics, and industry representatives. While addressing open science issues may not be their primary focus, this collaborative environment has the potential to contribute to those discussions. Institutions like Qatar University (QU) host conferences and workshops on research, innovation, and open access, providing opportunities for multi-stakeholder dialogues on open science, even if they do not specifically address the challenges outlined in section 16(h). Additionally, the Qatari government sometimes conducts public consultations on policy matters, creating a platform for gathering diverse perspectives that could also be utilized for discussions on open science. Dedicated National Policy Instruments for the Promotion of Open Science Qatar is making efforts to promote open science, but it is still in the early stages of establishing formal policy instruments for this purpose. However, Qatar has policy instruments within its broader science, technology, and innovation (STI) framework that promote open science by enabling open access to research, fostering collaboration, and supporting transparency. Some of the key policies and initiatives that are contributing to the advancement of open science in Qatar include: 1.
