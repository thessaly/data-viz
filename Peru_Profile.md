In February 2025, the UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science
document was sent to the same institutions as a reference and
complement to the previous official communication

### B1.2: Translation into national language(s)
Spanish

### B1.3: Awareness-raising activities organised
During 2024, the following awareness raising activities were carried out:
- Macro-regional meetings
Within the framework of the National STI Information Network, the
macro-regional meetings have been held since 2021. In 2024, three
meetings were held that brought together the member institutions of the
National Network of Open Access Digital Repositories of Science,
Technology and Innovation (RENARE) and the institutions adhered to
the PerúCRIS platform.
RENARE integrates and coordinates institutional open access
repositories of more than 200 public and private institutions in the
country, which are showcased in the ALICIA, a platform that centralizes
and disseminates the country's scientific and academic production,
promoting free access to knowledge. RENARE conducts annual
evaluations of institutional repositories to ensure compliance with
established guidelines.
PerúCRIS is a platform for the collection and dissemination of national
activities related to science, technology and innovation, with more than
100 member institutions. It follows international standards such as
OpenAIRE and the CERIF format.
The objective of the meetings was to review the scope of the Law of the
National System of Science, Technology and Innovation (Law No.
31250) and its regulations, published in June 2024, with regard to the
management of information in STI, the promotion of open science and
compliance with the timely deposit in open repositories of research
results with public funds, as well as to present the preliminary results of
the evaluation of open institutional repositories of the 2024 call:
● Northern Macro-regional Meeting, was held on August 21 in the
city of Chiclayo. The event was attended by 25 member
institutions of the Network. The event was co-organized with the
Universidad Católica Santo Toribio de Mogrovejo - USAT
● Southern Macro-regional Meeting, was held on November 13 in
the city of Arequipa. The event was co-organized with the
Universidad Nacional de San Agustín de Arequipa and
representatives of 17 institutions participated
● Central Macro-regional Meeting, was held on November 27 in
the city of Lima, the event was co-organized with the Universidad
Femenina del Sagrado Corazón and representatives of 53
institutions participated.
- Research Data Management Workshops
Workshops were held to adopt good practices in research data
management, aimed at researchers accredited in the National Scientific,
Technological and Innovation Registry (RENACYT), where the need to
incorporate the data management plan in project proposals and comply
with the deposit of research data from publicly funded projects in open
repositories was addressed.

## B2: Open Science Policies & Governance

### B2.2: National policies/legal frameworks aligned with Recommendation
Law No. 30035 establishes the National Digital Repository of Open
Access Science, Technology, and Innovation, also known as ALICIA. Its
purpose is to provide the academic, scientific, and general community
with access to the intellectual heritage resulting from scientific,
technological, and innovative production carried out in public sector
entities or funded by the State. The law aims to preserve, safeguard,
and ensure open access to these resources.
Law No. 31250, the Law of the National System of Science, Technology,
and Innovation (SINACTI), was enacted in 2021 and regulated in June
2024. The law's regulations explicitly establish the Promotion of Open
Science, based on its four key pillars: open scientific knowledge, open
science infrastructures, open participation of social actors, and open
dialogue with other knowledge systems. Additionally, it consolidates the
National STI Information Network as an open scientific knowledge
network, in alignment with Law No. 30035. Furthermore, it mandates the
deposit of data management plans and research data from publicly
funded projects in open repositories

### B2.3: Specific policy instruments promoting open science
Several instruments derived from the aforementioned legal frameworks
are available, including:
- The National Network of Open Access Digital Repositories of
Science, Technology, and Innovation (RENARE), established
under the regulations of Law No. 30035, which defines the
procedures and guidelines for repository operations and ensures
open access to scientific production.
- ALICIA Directive No. 001-2020-CONCYTEC-P, which sets the
guidelines, rules, and procedures for the integration and
evaluation of RENARE’s Institutional Repositories.
