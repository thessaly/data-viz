## B5 – Research Assessment and Incentives

### B5.1 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

The Malaysian Research Assessment (MyRA) Instrument is a comprehensive system designed to evaluate the research capabilities and performance of all Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in Malaysia. Introduced in 2006, its primary goal was to support the Malaysian Research University (MRU) initiative by the Ministry of Higher Education (MoHE), which aimed to designate five universities in Malaysia as Malaysian Research Universities (MRUs). Initially, MyRA was used to assess and monitor the research performance of public universities. However, starting in 2014, all HEIs, both public and private, were required to participate in the annual assessment, which coincided with the opening of MoHE research grants to all universities nationwide. MyRA now includes a 6-Star rating system, with all participating HEIs undergoing document and site audits conducted by a team of trained auditors. There are discussions on implementing open science elements in the research assessment and evaluation process, however, there are still no implemented initiatives relating to the matter. There are capacity building and awareness activities to shift the mindset to an open assessment and evaluation process. The review of alternative metrics to review the impact of research is being discussed.
