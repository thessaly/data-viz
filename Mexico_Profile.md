## B4 – Education, Capacity Building & Science Communication

### B4.1 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so.

To date, the Secretariat has not implemented concrete actions—such as surveys or other data-gathering tools—aimed at determining open science capacities in the country's higher education institutions. However, the possibility of including this initiative in the institutional agenda is being considered.

### B4.2 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so.

No, to date, no capacity-building program for the integration of fundamental values ​​and principles of open science has been implemented. However, SECIHTI, in each and every call for proposals, refers to the basic principle that everyone has the right to enjoy the benefits of the development of science and technological innovation and establishes that the State is obligated to support scientific, humanistic, and technological research and innovation, as well as guarantee open access to the information derived from it. Likewise, these types of documents promote inclusion by prioritizing proposals from researchers belonging to underrepresented communities and vulnerable groups, including Indigenous and Afro-descendant peoples, people living with disabilities, women, and people of color. These aspects, together, allude to values ​​such as "diversity and inclusion," "equity and justice," and "collective benefits" within the framework of the principles and values ​​of open science. For an example of this type of call, see: https://secihti.mx/wp-content/uploads/convocatorias_secihti/convocatorias-ciencia-y-humanidades/ciencia-basica-frontera/2025/Conv_CDF2025_VF.pdf

### B4.3 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so.

No, so far no actions have been implemented to include open science competences in the curricula, mainly because each educational institution has a certain autonomy in this area. However, the recognition of tools such as the repository and other applications developed by SECIHTI that take into account the principles and values of open science can be promoted.

### B4.5 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

area and indicate if there are plans to do so. Yes, the Conahcyt, now the SECIHTI, once promoted a "Conference on Scientific Communication and Universal Access to Knowledge". Its aim was to bring knowledge in the humanities, sciences, technologies and innovation closer to society as a mechanism to guarantee the human right to science for the benefit of Mexico.  https://secihti.mx/evento/jornadas-de-comunicacion-cientifica-y-acceso-universal-al-conocimiento/

## B5 – Research Assessment and Incentives

### B5.1 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so.

No, however, we recognize the efforts of entities such as UNAM, which have promoted Open Access policies (https://www.unamenlinea.unam.mx/recurso/82924-lineamientos-generales-para-la-politica-de-acceso-abierto-de-la-unam) that are aligned with the principles and values ​​of Open Science. We also recognize some actions that the Autonomous Metropolitan University (https://boletines.uam.mx/archivos/463-23/) has designed as a mechanism for adopting the relevant culture. Additionally, these topics will be analyzed for possible inclusion in the agenda.

### B5.2 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

Yes, as part of the bases for formulating, executing and evaluating public policies, Article 11, Section XVIII establishes the “construction and development of a humanistic, scientific, technological and innovation culture based on epistemological rigor, dialogue of knowledge, horizontal and transversal production of knowledge, epistemic plurality and equity, interculturality, collaborative work and the vindication of the humanities […].” As part of the application examples, the “Analysis Forum. The Mayan milpa, productive and social ecosystem: dialogue of knowledge and impact in southeastern Mexico” is shared, which in addition to sharing experiences on the subject, promoted the articulation of projects in favor of the communities of the region, it is very likely that these types of elements will be considered in the present and future actions of the agenda, which are aligned with the practices of open science. For further information, see: https://secihti.mx/evento/foro-de-analisis-la-milpa-maya-ecosistema-productivo-y-social-dialogo-de-saberes-e-incidencia-en-el-sureste-mexicano/  https://www.dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.php?codigo=5688048&fecha=08/05/2023#gsc.tab=0

### B5.3 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so.

No. To date, no specific initiatives have been established in this area, nor are their implementation planned for the end of 2025. However, the Secretariat remains committed to evaluating the feasibility of such measures within its science policy agenda.

## B7 – International Cooperation

### B7.1 — How is your country promoting and facilitating international scientific collaborations on open science as outlined in the 2021 Recommendation on Open Science?

The General Law on Humanities, Science, Technology and Innovation makes open access to publicly funded research mandatory. This legal requirement (set out in Article 56) ensures that the results of publicly funded research are openly available, which in itself facilitates international access and potential collaboration. In addition, the Specific Guidelines for the Integration and Operation of Repositories place particular emphasis on ensuring that records of information products in repositories comply with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) principles to facilitate communication with other platforms and speed up information retrieval by the global scientific community, in line with the objectives of the UNESCO Recommendation. https://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/LGMHCTI.pdf

### B7.2 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

Yes, partially. Article 10, Section VI of the Internal Regulations of the Secretariat of Science, Humanities, Technology, and Innovation establishes that the Undersecretariat of Science and Humanities is responsible for promoting inter-institutional collaboration, as well as inter- and multidisciplinary research groups, with various sectors of society, to stimulate basic and cutting-edge research in all fields of knowledge and strengthen national humanistic research agendas. This aspect supports the General Law on Humanities, Science, Technology, and Innovation in guaranteeing the human right to science and open access to information derived from state-funded research.  https://www.dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.php?codigo=5747752&fecha=24/01/2025#gsc.tab=0  https://www.dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.php?codigo=5688048&fecha=08/05/2023#gsc.tab=0

### B7.3 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so.

No, not at this time, but considering the significance of these elements, the feasibility of including this item in the Secretariat's agenda will be analyzed.
