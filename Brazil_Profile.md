The Recommendation has been disseminated through various channels in Brazil and through lectures on Open Science. The Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation has disseminated the principles of the Recommendation, through its Directorate of Data Governance and Science and Technology Indicators, which coordinates the activities under Commitment #3 of the 6th Brazilian Open Government Action Plan (see answer to 1.3). The main publications available are those from the two universities mentioned as follows:  University of São Paulo (< https://www.acessoaberto.usp.br/unesco-recomendacoes-ciencia-aberta/?doing_wp_cron=1748616357.1096160411834716796875  >) Federal University of Minas Gerais (< https://www.ufmg.br/periodicos/recomendacoes-da-unesco-para-ciencia-aberta/  >)

### B1.2 — If yes, which language(s)?

Portuguese

### B1.3 — If yes, please provide details on the activities organized or foreseen and links as relevant

The Brazilian Society for the Advancement of Science (SBPC) has promoted debates on open science at its annual meetings. It has also organised publications on the topic, such as a special edition on the topic in the Jornal da Ciência newspaper and an issue of the Ciência & Cultura magazine (< https://revistacienciaecultura.org.br/ >).  Under the 6th Brazilian Action Plan of the Open Government Partnership (OGP), 2024-2027, Commitment 3 seeks to promote transparent, collaborative and reproducible scientific practices, expanding the social impact of science. Among its actions, Milestone 9 provides for awareness-raising activities on open science, aimed at researchers, public institutions and civil society. These initiatives are conducted by national and/or international entities and authorities and aim to disseminate the benefits and challenges of open science, strengthening the culture of open access and transparency in the country (see pages 21-29 at https://www.gov.br/cgu/pt-br/governo-aberto/a-ogp/planos-de-acao/6deg-plano-de-acao-brasileiro/brazil_action-plan_2023-2027_december_pt.pdf).  The Brazilian Reproducibility Network hosted a free conference on Reproducibility in Brazilian Research as a preparatory activity for the 5th National Conference on Science, Technology, and Innovation (available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMh2448s1mY and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLKClGEMxfw), addressing various aspects of open science. It also developed recommendations for the valorisation of open and reproducible science in the evaluation of postgraduate programmes by CAPES (https://osf.io/8ysj2), presenting them to the agency's Technical Scientific Council. Similar recommendations were recently developed for national journals (https://osf.io/spnry).   The 14th CONFOA (Lusophone Conference on Open Science) was held in 2023 at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, in the city of Natal. Between 8 and 11 September, the 16th CONFOA - Lusophone Conference on Open Science will take place at the Federal University of Goiás (UFG), in Goiânia. In 2024, the 1st UFG Open Science Week was held to promote the theme among the academic and regional community. The Brazilian Institute of Information in Science and Technology (Ibict), in collaboration with the Foundation for Science and Technology of Portugal and the University of Minho, also in Portugal, has been a permanent organiser of ConfOA since its inception. The 2025 edition of the Conference is organised locally by the Federal University of Goiás (UFG). In July 2025, the III Meeting of the Brazilian Network of Digital Repositories will also be held, a joint organisation of the Brazilian Institute of Science and Technology Information (Ibict), the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz), Brazilian Centre for Physics Research (CBPF), Federal University of Amazonas (UFAM), Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN), Federal University of Goiás (UFG), Federal University of Rio Grande (FURG) and Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS). The purpose of this meeting is to bring together the community involved in research publication and data repositories to discuss ways to maintain and expand the Brazilian Network of Digital Repositories, as well as the opportunities and challenges it faces. In addition, the theme of the 2025 edition of the National Seminar on University Libraries (SNBU) is: ‘Open Science: (im)possible reality?’, where the Brazilian Institute of Information in Science and Technology (Ibict) will hold workshops related to the central theme of the Seminar.

### B1.4 — If yes, please indicate the actions that are taken to incorporate the specific values and principles. For each case, please provide details and links as relevant

The Brazilian Institute of Information in Science and Technology (Ibict) coordinated the implementation of a commitment in the 5th Open Government Partnership (OGP) Plan, related to new evaluation mechanisms in science, in order to promote Open Science. The results of the implementation of this commitment are summarised at: https://www.gov.br/ibict/pt-br/assuntos/informacao-cientifica/ogp-brasil . In addition, the Brazilian Institute of Science and Technology Information is responsible for coordinating Milestone 04 - ‘Development of a proposal on how to incorporate open practices into the evaluation criteria for researchers and institutions, based on the 5th National Action Plan,’ in the 6th OGP Plan, in a commitment related to the theme of Open Science.  The Brazilian Reproducibility Network is currently developing a list of recommendations for promoting open science in Brazilian postgraduate programmes, which is expected to be published by the end of 2025.  FAPESP, the São Paulo State Research Foundation, has established a Policy for Open Access to Publications and requires that any institution or researcher apllying for research grants present a data management plan (https://fapesp.br/12632/portaria-cta-no-012019). FAPESP also requires that the research results funded by the Foundation be deposited in open access repositories, whether institutional or other scientific data repositories. This policy aims to ensure that research funded with public resources is widely accessible and disseminated.

## B2 – Open Science Policies and Governance

### B2.2 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so

No, there is no consolidated national policy, although Brazil is engaged in the Open Government Partnership (OGP) since 2011. The 4th, 5th and the 6th Brazilian Action Plans for Open Government bring activities which show the commitment of the country with open science.The 6th Action Plan, Commitment #3, Collaboration Practices for Science and Technology, consists of 13 sets of activities, which will contribute to the design of a national policy for open science (see Milestone 7) and corresponding Action Plan (see Milestone 8).   6th Open Government Action Plan (see pages 21-29): https://www.gov.br/cgu/pt-br/governo-aberto/a-ogp/planos-de-acao/6deg-plano-de-acao-brasileiro/brazil_action-plan_2023-2027_december_pt.pdf

### B2.3 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so

No, at the national level. However there are institutional level documents, related to Open Science policies, with a model case being that of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz), which has formalised its actions on the subject through a set of documents. Examples:   https://sei.fiocruz.br/sei/publicacoes/controlador_publicacoes.php?acao=publicacao_visualizar&id_documento=775494&id_orgao_publicacao=0, which establishes the governance of Open Science at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz). In addition, the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz) published its ‘Policy on data management, sharing and openness for research: principles and guidelines’ (< https://www.arca.fiocruz.br/handle/icict/46408 >).  The Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) published the reference document containing the common guidelines for the permanence evaluation process (https://www.gov. br/capes/pt-br/centrais-de-conteudo/documentos/avaliacao/19052025_20250502_DocumentoReferencial_FICHA. pdf  ), on 02/05/2025, which included open science and good practices in training, research and scientific dissemination as one of the evaluation dimensions (pg 64).

### B2.4 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so

See answer to question 2.2.

### B2.5 — Please provide more information, including the number of policies, name of the institute(s) that has/have developed the policy(s) and elements of open science included in the policy (please consider policies and strategies addressing all elements of open science, including citizen
and participatory  science, or co-production of knowledge with multiple actors).

Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz): 2 policies - Open Access to Knowledge Policy (https://www.arca.fiocruz.br/handle/icict/68656) and Policy on Management, Sharing and Opening of Data for Research (https://www.arca.fiocruz.br/handle/icict/46408).                                                                           Federal University of Goiás (UFG): Institutional Development Plan - encouraging institutional actions related to Open Science.  The State University of Campinas (UNICAMP) has an institutional open access policy: https://www.pg.unicamp.br/norma/23869/0.   The University of São Paulo (USP) has open science policies, including open access, shared infrastructure and citizen science (https://cienciaaberta.usp.br/).  The Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre has infrastructure to support data management and has already conducted small experiments in selection processes to evaluate researchers according to the Hong Kong Principles (which include recognition of open science practices).

### B2.7 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so

No, at the national level. The issue is present in ongoing  discussions and will certainly be part of the next National STI Strategy. However, three examples can be mentioned, each from a different type of institutional level: federal, state and private.  Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz): In the call for proposals for the Inova Programme for the Promotion of Research and Technological Development (PIPDT) - Institute of Communication and Information in Health (Icict)/Fiocruz, the preparation of a data management plan was incorporated as a requirement for funding. https://pipdt.icict.fiocruz.br/   The São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) has systematically included the request for a Data Management Plan in its various calls for funding. < https://fapesp.br/gestaodedados  > and a Policy for Open Access to Publications Resulting from FAPESP Grants and Scholarships < https://fapesp.br/12632/portaria-cta-no-012019 >  The Serrapilheira Institute has developed a Guide to Good Practices in Open and Reproducible Science, which is attached to its calls for proposals < https://serrapilheira.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/serrapilheira-guia-ciencia-aberta-e-reprodutivel.pdf  >

### B2.8 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so

Such efforts are not presently embedded in the instruments that support public-private partnerships, but are being discussed for the next National STI Strategy.

### B2.9 — Please provide details and links as relevant

The Brazilian Open Science Observatory (OCABr), coordinated by SciELO (Scientific Electronic Open Library), which tracks Open Science practices in Brazil, plans to release its first public version by the end of 2025. The indicators cover policy indexing, educational resources, portals, and scientific output. OCABr plans to use the OpenAlex and SciELO databases to monitor scientific production in Open Access. The OCABr project is a product of the 5th OGP Plan and its implementation is led by the SciELO Programme with financial support from CNPq. < https://25.scielo.org/seminarios/ocabr/  >
