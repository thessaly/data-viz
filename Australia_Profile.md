## B1 – Promotion of the UNESCO 2021 Recommendation on Open Science

### B1.2 — If yes, which language(s)?

English

### B1.3 — If yes, please provide details on the activities organized or foreseen and links as relevant

Organisations like Open Access Australasia (OAA) and the Council of Australian University Librarians (CAUL) actively promote open access. They advocate for policies that align with international standards like those from UNESCO. Australia’s former Chief Scientist, Dr Cathy Foley, actively advocated for open access to research literature during her tenure. She released a report that makes the case for a public access model that would provide access to academic journal articles (including international-authored articles and the back catalogues) for all Australians, as well as open access publishing of all Australian led research so that it is free for readers to access globally.  The Australian Open Science Network has held several webinars that raise awareness on open science.

### B1.4 — If yes, please indicate the actions that are taken to incorporate the specific values and principles. For each case, please provide details and links as relevant

National Health and Medical Research Council’s (NHMRC) Open Access Policy and Research Quality Strategy are aligned with the values and principles of open science. The Open Access Policy mandates that publications are made immediately open access with a Creative Commons Attribution “CC BY” licence and encourages data to be made available with open licencing. The Open Access Policy encourages bibliodiversity through supporting all routes to open access, with no preference for one. The Open Access Policy specifically addresses research involving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and communities, providing guidance on meeting open access requirements for publications while considering the values of justice, equity, respect and responsibility and the principles of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander self-determination and leadership, sustainability and accountability. NHMRC underwent a public consultation process in April-May 2021 about the proposed changes to its Open Access Policy to require immediate open access and CC BY licencing.  MRFF grant recipients are required to ensure that research publications (and associated research data) are openly accessible, except where publication may compromise the organisation’s obligations with respect to patient privacy, intellectual property and/or commercially confidential information. Additionally, the National Open Science Taskforce (NOST) was formed to represent key research stakeholders and advocate for sectoral ownership and leadership on matters of Open Science. Please view attached document for more information.

While there isn't a single policy at the national level that addresses open science, the Australian Government's 2024 National Science Statement calls for enhanced efforts to “Modernise our science agency systems and decision-making mechanisms, including to better support open science and cross disciplinary and cross institution collaborations”. NHMRC’s Open Access Policy [PDF] uses the UNESCO definition of open science and is aligned with the values and principles of open science. Publications are required to be immediately open access with a CC BY licence and data is encouraged to be made available with open licencing. The ARC has an Open Access Policy [PDF] which applies to all Research Outputs that come from ARC Funded Research, and their Metadata. Any Research Outputs arising from an ARC research Project must be made accessible within 12 months from the date of publication.    (see table in doc)

### B2.3 — Please provide details and links as relevant, including for each instrument: Title of the instrument, its objective, the authority in charge, allocated budget, elements of open science included

While there isn't a single policy instrument titled "Open Science Policy," these various initiatives collectively serve to promote and advance open science practices in Australia. The landscape is characterised by a combination of mandates from funding bodies, institutional policies, national strategies, and advocacy efforts, all contributing to a culture of open science. Open Access Mandates from Funding Bodies, for example, Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF), National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) and Australian Research Council (ARC). National Strategies and Statements including the Australian Government's 2024 National Science Statement, Australia 2030: Prosperity through Innovation and National Health and Medical Research Strategy. Open Data Initiatives: Data.gov.au Institutional Policies: Australian universities have their own open science or open access policies, which mandate or encourage researchers to make their work openly available.  Government Initiatives and Proposals: Chief Scientist's Proposal - Dr. Cathy Foley (former Chief Scientist) has proposed a public access model that would involve national read and publish agreements with publishers. Dr Foley’s advice will be considered through appropriate mechanisms.

### B2.4 — Please provide details and links as relevant, including the name of ministries and national authorities/entities, as well as affiliated organizations that are involved in the development and implementation of the plan, strategy or the roadmap

The Australian Government is undertaking a strategic examination of our research and development system, to be completed by December 2025. This review, along with the recent advice on open access models (by former Australian Chief Scientist, Dr Cathy Foley) may inform Australia’s strategic approach to open access.

### B2.5 — Please provide more information, including the number of policies, name of the institute(s) that has/have developed the policy(s) and elements of open science included in the policy (please consider policies and strategies addressing all elements of open science, including citizen
and participatory  science, or co-production of knowledge with multiple actors).

In Australia, institutional policies and strategies for promoting open science are multifaceted, involving various stakeholders across academia, government, and research funding bodies. Examples include:

### B2.6 — Please provide details and links as relevant

There are several funding mechanisms in Australia that support aspects of open science, even if not all are explicitly labelled as "open science" funding. Examples include:  National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS) Australian Research Council (ARC) Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF) NHMRC grant funds may be used to support costs associated with publications and open access.

### B2.7 — Please provide details and links as relevant

In Australia, open science practices have been partially integrated into existing research funding mechanisms, but the extent and consistency vary. Examples include: Australian Research Council (ARC) National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF)

### B2.8 — Please provide details and links as relevant

Australia has made significant efforts to foster equitable public-private partnerships in open science, primarily through existing infrastructure programs (NCRIS, ARDC) and CSIRO collaborations. By the end of 2025, increased efforts are foreseen, driven by UNESCO reporting, national policy rollout, and regional leadership ambitions, likely resulting in pilot projects and draft policies.

### B2.9 — Please provide details and links as relevant

Australia has policies, advocacy, and collaborative networks that support open science, and it is envisaged that over time they could lead to development of a national monitoring framework for open science.

### B3.2 — What is the latest official data for the percentage of your country's population that have access to reliable internet and bandwidth? Please also indicate the year of publication of this data, and to which year(s) it refers

In 2024, with a current population of 26.6 million,  94.9% of adult  Australians are internet users with reliable internet and bandwidth.

### B3.3 — Please provide more information and links as relevant, and indicate to which open science actors in your country those networks are accessible

In Australia, the national and international NREN operator is the Australian Academic and Research Network (AARNet).

### B3.5 — Please provide links as relevant and more information, including the name of the infrastructure, date of establishment, language, target groups and beneficiaries, governance/community agreements, scope

While Australia does not host a single infrastructure, named "federated regional or international IT infrastructure" for open science, its participation in, and contributions to, various networks, projects, and initiatives effectively create a federated environment where data and resources are shared both nationally and globally for the advancement of open science. Many of these facilities are supported by the NCRIS program. National Contributions to International Infrastructures Open Science Initiatives The Global Sustainability Coalition for Open Science Services (SCOSS) While not directly hosted by Australia, Australian institutions like the Australian National University and Queensland University of Technology have been involved in supporting SCOSS through funding and advocacy. SCOSS helps secure funding for critical open science infrastructure globally since 2017. Federated Regional Infrastructures  Australian Academic and Research Network (AARNet) Although primarily national, AARNet serves as Australia's gateway to international networks, effectively creating a federated environment where Australian researchers can seamlessly interact with global research infrastructures. Established in 1989, AARNet's connections extend to various international research and education networks, enhancing federated access to IT resources for open science. Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) ARDC operates Research Data Australia (RDA), which not only aggregates metadata from Australian data providers but also aligns with international standards for data sharing. This platform supports the principles of federated access by making Australian research data discoverable and accessible to both national and international researchers. International Research Collaboration Square Kilometre Array (SKA)  While the SKA itself is an international project, Australia hosts part of the infrastructure (the ASKAP telescope) since 2012 and is involved in the development of SKA's data processing capabilities. This project exemplifies federated international collaboration in science and technology, with data being shared across continents.  Funding and Hosting: Australian Access Federation (AAF) AAF facilitates federated identity management, allowing researchers from different institutions to access shared resources securely. This supports the infrastructure for open science by simplifying access to data and services across institutions and, by extension, internationally. National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS) NCRIS provides funding for various projects that could be considered part of a federated infrastructure for open science. For instance: Bioplatforms Australia supports the sharing of biological data in an open science framework, contributing to international genomic data resources. The Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) participates in global biodiversity data initiatives, contributing Australian data to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS)

### B3.6 — Please provide links as relevant and more information, including the name of the infrastructure, date of establishment, language, target groups and beneficiaries, governance/community agreements, scope

Australia is deeply engaged in North-South, North-South-South, and South-South collaborations to optimise infrastructure use and advance open science platforms. Through partnerships like Landsat Next, Southern Ocean Observing System (SOOS), and regional initiatives (including CSIRO’s Regional Partnerships) in the Pacific and Southeast Asia. Australia leverages its position to bridge northern and southern interests. These efforts not only enhance scientific capacity and infrastructure efficiency but also promote equitable access to knowledge and resources, aligning with global goals for sustainable development and regional prosperity.

## B5 – Research Assessment and Incentives

### B5.1 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

The Universities Accord Panel’s Final Report recommends open data (which supports open science) be leveraged to support research evaluation processes (p 220).

### B5.2 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so.

In Australia, the incorporation of specific clauses from the UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science particularly those recognising open science practices such as sharing, collaborating, engaging with societal actors beyond the scientific community, and fostering dialogue with other knowledge systems, into career evaluation and progression systems is underway but remains incomplete. Many institutions, including UNSW, now adopt societal impact frameworks. Progress reflects Australia’s commitment to open science, as evidenced by national policies and institutional reforms, yet full integration into career frameworks is still evolving.

### B5.3 — For each initiative, please provide more information, including on the stakeholders[i] that are involved or lead the initiative, and links as relevant.

There are several initiatives in Australia aimed at rewarding and promoting open science practices, including:  Open Science Badges: Some Australian journals have adopted the use of Open Science Badges, which are visual indicators that acknowledge researchers for sharing data, materials, or for pre-registering their studies. These badges are used by journals to signal and reward open practices, although this is more on a journal-to-journal basis rather than a widespread national initiative.  Incentives through Funding Bodies: NHMRC has policies that support open access and open data, with a mandate for immediate open access for NHMRC-funded research. While not explicitly an award, this policy incentivises open practices by making it a condition of funding. Similarly, ARC requires funded research to be made open access within 12 months, which indirectly rewards open science by setting expectations and mandates. NHMRC is a signatory of the 2012 San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment and the Agreement on Reforming Research Assessment and are members of the Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment (CoARA). NHMRC is developing an action plan aligned with the CoARA core commitments. NHMRC funding schemes that assess publication history require applicants to not include publication metrics such as journal impact factors and provide guidance to peer reviewers on assessing the quality of research publications. NHMRC’s Open Access Policy encourages research institutions to consider rewarding open science practices as part of their recruitment, evaluation and promotion processes. NHMRC is developing a Good Institutional Practice Guide, to provide guidance to NHMRC-funded institutions and NHMRC-funded researchers about good institutional practice to promote open, honest, supportive and respectful institutional cultures conducive to the conduct of high-quality research. The Guide encourages recognising and rewarding open science practices.

## B6 – Engagement of Societal Actors & Open Innovation

### B6.1 — Indicate which of the recommended actions they address

National Level: Former Chief Scientist, Dr Foley published a report and hosted a webinar outlining her advice on open access models, which has been submitted for consideration by the Australian Government. NHMRC’s Open Access Policy encourages the posting of preprints on preprint servers with open licensing. NHMRC accepts preprints in grant applications. NHMRC’s Open Access Policy strongly encourages grant recipients to take reasonable steps to share research data and associated metadata arising from NHMRC-funded research. NHMRC’s Targeted Calls for Research funding scheme enables community and professional groups to submit research topics that may be underfunded or have a significant research knowledge gap. Consumer and community representatives are routinely appointed to NHMRC Council and Principal Committees and, where appropriate, working committees. NHMRC is trialing the involvement of consumer and community reviewers in peer review for select grant opportunities.  For some MRFF grant opportunities the policy underlying dissemination of research outcomes linked to clinical trials include (with the exception where publication may compromise obligations with respect to patient privacy, intellectual property and/or commercially confidential information) grantees are required to:  if a clinical trial, submit the clinical trial protocol to an open access repository within six months of Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) approval, or publish a protocol manuscript as soon as practicable. within 12 months of completion of the grant activity, disseminate the research findings through: ensuring that research findings are available in an open access repository. content specific forums submission to peer-reviewed journals. make lay summaries available to research participants, concurrently with sharing and dissemination of research results. Institutional Level: The CAUL Open Education Resources Collective enables number of Open Educational Resources (OERs), published through PressBooks. Australian Universities have their own policies which encourages exploration of open peer-review practices, sharing of negative results and associated data, and promote open innovative practices to increase the openness of the scientific process.

## B7 – International Cooperation

### B7.1 — How is your country promoting and facilitating international scientific collaborations on open science as outlined in the 2021 Recommendation on Open Science?

The Universities Accord Panel’s Final Report highlights the importance of coordinating open access (to national research infrastructure) to enable Australia to adapt to technological shifts.  Australia's Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) engages multilaterally through the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and regionally through the Regional Cooperative Agreement for Research, Development and Training Related to Nuclear Science and Technology for Asia and the Pacific (RCA) and the Forum for Nuclear Cooperation in Asia (FNCA). The RCA is a Treaty level agreement between 22 countries in Asia and the Pacific under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). ANSTO also engages bilaterally with similar counterparts around the world. Australia has established partnerships across various universities (Australian and international) collaborating across joint scientific research including participation in the Council of Australasian University Librarians (CAUL), which includes most of Australia’s universities and major Australian Government-funded research agencies such as the CSIRO, Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG) and ANSTO, and has negotiated open access agreements with over 20 publishers since 2020. The ANSTO Open Science Portal website provides access to research data, and ANSTO also hosts the Australian IAEA International Nuclear Information System (INIS) with a statutory responsibility to identify, capture and index relevant Australian literature in the field of nuclear science and technology for INIS for free global access and engages in multidisciplinary and international research (p 206).

### B7.2 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

Relevant Australian Government agencies plan and collaborate on open science.  There is currently no singular national strategy on this. NHMRC are members of several international working groups, committees and communities of best practice related to open science and research assessment. These include the Asia-Pacific DoRA Funders working group, cOAlition S Leaders and Experts committees, and CoARA working groups. NHMRC has engaged with UNESCO Open Science working groups. MRFF has representatives that engage with DoRA Funders working groups and attend regular meetings within this context.

### B7.3 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

Australia is a member of several international organisations and working groups that provide funding mechanisms for Open Science. These include DoRA Funders and CoARA working groups. Regional organisations included MRFF, NHMRC, ACR. In addition, Open Access Australasia engages with and promotes to the university sector the activities and approaches of international organisations such as Invest in Open Infrastructure and the SCOSS. CAUL also actively promotes SCOSS and their initiatives.
