## B2 – Open Science Policies and Governance

### B2.1 — Share a machine-readable PDF file of the policy

In line with the Act on Research and Development Funding in 2024–2030 (1092/2022, see link 1 below), the Finnish Government shall adopt a plan for the use of central government research and development funding once every electoral term (current term is 2023-2027). The multiannual plan for the use of government research and development funding (see link 2 below) published in 2024 presents the current state of the research, development and innovation system, the objectives of the system and the main policies for the use of R&D funding. Decisions on the actual allocation of funding are made as part of the normal budgetary process.                                On 9 October 2023, the Ministry of Education and Culture and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment appointed a working group to draft a proposal for the plan. The working group was responsible for drawing up the proposal for the plan and its monitoring mechanisms and for holding consultations with stakeholders. The wide-ranging group of stakeholders was tasked with supporting and monitoring the preparations, producing expert information and presenting views on the policies in the plan. The preparations were led by the Research and Innovation Council (see link 3 below) and involved extensive consultation with the stakeholders.  The main policy priorities identified in the plan involve increasing cooperation between R&D actors, promoting ambitious R&D activities in businesses, strengthening competence, improving research and technology infrastructure, deepening EU and other international cooperation and making strategic choices. The plan also describes the expected impacts and presents indicators to support monitoring. The plan does not include any of the mentioned open science elements.

In Finland, the Declaration of Open Science (2020) and Research and its supporting policies (see link 1 below) have been developed by the Finnish   research   community (see Q 2.4). The Declaration is supported by four policies, one in each of the areas of open science, as well as one policy component common for two areas, number 5 in the below list: 1.	Policy for open scholarship (2022) (see link 2 below) 2.	Open access to scholarly publications. National Policy and executive plan by the research community in Finland for 2020–2025 (2019) (see link 3 below) 3.	Open research data and methods. National policy and executive plan by the higher education and research community for 2021–2025: Policy component 1 (Open access to research data) (2021) and 2 (Open access to research methods and infrastructures) (2023) (see link 4 below) 4.	Open education and educational resources. National policy and executive plan by the higher education and research community for 2021-2025. Policy components 1 (Open access to educational resources) (2020) and 2 (Open educational practices) (2022) (see link 5 below) 5.	Open education and educational resources, open access to scholarly publications. National policy and executive plan by the higher education and research community for 2021–2025: Policy component for open access to theses (2024) (see link 6 below) There is also some national legislation supporting the principles of open sciences: The Finnish Act on the Openness of Government Activities (621/1999, see link 7 below), ensures the transparency of public administration (including public expert and research institutes) by granting individuals the right to access/request official documents held by authorities. It establishes the principle of openness while also specifying exceptions to protect privacy, national security, and other sensitive information. The Directive on Open Data and Public Sector Information (Directive (EU) 2019/1024) was implemented through national legislation: Act on the Reuse of Publicly Funded Research Data (713/2021, see link 8 below). The act applies to research data that is publicly funded and made publicly available through a data repository by researchers, research organisations, or organisations funding research. Data Protection Act (Tietosuojalaki 1050/2018, see link 9 below) implements the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Finland. It governs how personal data is collected, processed, and shared in research. Statistics Act (Tilastolaki 280/2004, see link 10 below) governs the use and sharing of statistical data produced by public institutions in Finland.  Copyright Act (404/1961, amendments up to 1216/2023, see link 11 below) has provisions on text and data mining. Research organisations and cultural heritage institutions with lawful access to a work may reproduce it in order to carry out text and data mining in scientific research and retain the copies for the purpose of scientific research, including for the subsequent verification of research results, provided that the copies are only available to those with lawful access to them. These provisions shall not be derogated from in contracts and agreements, nor shall its application be prevented by technical means.

Formal Tampere University is piloting a training program for Data Stewards in 2025 (see the link below). Training is arranged by the Unit Tree – Continuing Education. Its extent is 15 European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) credits.  This training is new and unique in its kind as Finland has lacked training aimed at the qualification of experts in the field of data management. The training has been designed and planned with extensive national cooperation. National data management operators and experts in the field have also been involved in the planning phase. Open science and FAIR data are included in this training. The primary target group for this training is doctoral researchers. The training is also suitable for those who have already completed their thesis and/or who have already done some expert work in data management. This training is funded by the Ministry of Education and Culture. Link: https://www.tuni.fi/en/study-with-us/tautree-data-steward

Already in the early stages of open science development, educational material for policy makers was developed, e.g. a handbook on open science and research in 2014 (see link 1 below, in Finnish only). More recent initiatives in this area with the Open Science Coordination are the working group Interaction with Decision-makers & Open Administration within the Culture of Open Science Expert Panel (see link 2 below) and the recommendation The criteria for a good knowledge base (2024) (see link 3 below). The recommendation is aimed at the drafters of legislation and comprises best practices for building a solid knowledge base on the basis of principles of responsible research. The key purpose of this recommendation is to supplement the guidelines for drafting government proposals. Open Science Coordination also had a working group for Co-operation in national information policy under the expert panel of research data. The period of this working group ended in 2022.

If this question refers to a national framework, it is not applicable to Finland as universities and universities of applied sciences have autonomy (See Universities Act in link 1 below, and Universities of Applied Sciences Act in link 2 below) However, based on replies to the question on a policy on skills/training for Open Science in the national OS monitoring 2024, 66 % of Finnish universities and universities of applied sciences had such a policy. This question is a part of the EOSC National Contributions to EOSC questionnaire and does not yield points in the national OS monitoring. It is included as data collection for the EOSC survey. Replies to the question on the number of educational curricula with an Open Science dimension in 2022 in the national OS monitoring 2024 have variation. Some universities and universities of applied sciences replied only the number of curricula with OS dimension, others provided also the total number of curricula, and some replied simply “all curricula as OS is integrated to the courses supporting thesis work”. 9 of 13 universities and 11 of 23 universities of applied sciences provided either a numeric or textual response indicating their curricula include open science. The file containing the full dataset of the national OS monitoring 2024 is not yet openly accessible. It will be made fully openly accessible in early 2025. Therefore, a link can be provided only in early 2025. Link 1: https://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/kaannokset/2009/en20090558.pdf Link 2: https://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/2014/en20140932

In 2018 Committee for Public Information in Finland released Bold communication, responsible influence. Science communication recommendations (see link 1 below). The recommendations are intended for everyone who works with science and those who communicate on science: science belongs to everyone. 4th recommendation addresses open science directly: “Support for science communication: High-quality, multifaceted science communication and science journalism build an open science culture and trust in science and research. Communication reaches different audiences.” The explanatory texts states that science communication is part of a culture of open science. Finland has a national CoARA chapter (Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment, see link 2 below) and 19 organizations with a CoARA action plan. One of the core CoARA commitments is to recognise the diversity of contributions to, and careers in, research in accordance with the needs and nature of the research (see link 3 below). This commitment will broaden recognition of the diverse practices, activities and careers in research, considering the specific nature of research disciplines and other research endeavours. This includes science communication framed in the question.

## B5 – Research Assessment and Incentives

### B5.1 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

In Finland, promoting responsible research is an ongoing endeavour. The national recommendation “Good practice in researcher evaluation. Recommendation for the responsible evaluation of a researcher in Finland” was approved in 2020 (link 1). This recommendation has been drafted from the point of view of an individual researcher evaluation. The same principles should be followed when evaluating research organizations, research units, and research in a broader context. The recommendation is recommended to use in conjunction with The Finnish Advisory Board on Research Integrity’s (TENK) template for a researcher’s curriculum vitae.  In the section on the evaluation of research, the open science is one of the elements: Open access to research Researchers’ activities to promote open access to research outputs will be considered as part of the evaluation. Promoting open access is seen as part of the realisation of the fundamental values of research, societal impact, and the promotion of research. (link 1) In the national open science monitoring 2024, 58 % of the responding RPOs had a policy document promoting that open science can be taken into consideration in assessments related to recruitment or career development or in other professional assessments, and 26 % plan to develop a policy in the next 12 months (see link 2 below for survey).  In the same survey, in 64 % of the responding RPOs “Recommendation for the responsible evaluation of a researcher in Finland” has been taken into consideration and this has been reported as part of promoting responsible assessment within the organisation, and 23 % of the respondents intend doing so (see link 2 below for survey). Finnish Higher Education Institutes (HEI) and state research institutes are actively adopting the CoARA recommendation. The CoARA National Chapter Finland has 43 members, including 13 of 14 universities, 21 of 24 universities of applied sciences, 5 reseach institutes and the Research Council of Finland (link 3).  The FIN-CAM tool for researcher assessment is under development. Promoting open science is listed as one example in skills and capabilities. As examples in qualitative evaluation, the effectiveness and use of open publications, preprints, machine-readable data, open notebooks, methods or educational materials are mentioned. In quantitative evaluation, the number of open research outputs and funding received for open science and projects completed are listed as examples. (Link to the FIN-CAM model is forthcoming in January 2025 when public consultation is opened.)

The Finnish National Board on Research Integrity TENK, Universities Finland UNIFI, Rectors’ Conference of Finnish Universities of Applied Sciences Arene and the Academy of Finland prepared the first template for the researcher’s curriculum vitae (CV) in accordance with the responsible conduct of research for Finnish research organisations in 2012. This curriculum vitae template was updated in 2020. The aim of the template is to provide guidelines for the writer of a CV so that the individual’s merits are presented as comprehensively, truthfully and comparably as possible. TENK recommends that organisations adopt the template in its original format. However, specific instructions on how to use the template must be provided in each situation (see link 1 below) Section 14 in the TENK template addresses scientific and societal impact. It includes, e.g. promoting open science and research, for example the production and responsible distribution of research material and datasets, as well as key positions of trust, expert positions and assignments and merits in research communication and appearing as an expert in the media. (see link 2 below) In the national OS monitoring, one of the indicators assesses the use of the TENK CV template. The organisations must have enabled the alternative only if its use in evaluation is reflected in the organisation’s recruitment, HR and / or evaluation guidelines and the person being evaluated has the opportunity to enter the necessary information into one of the platforms used in the evaluation. 51 % of all respondents have enabled providing information on other merits besides research outputs. By organisation type, there is much variation as the response rate was 100 % for the universities and 45 % for the research institutes and 26 % for the universities of applied sciences. (see link 3 below) Steering-group for Responsible Researcher Assessment & Working Group is currently developing Career Assessment Matrix (FIN-CAM) of qualitative and quantitative criteria for researcher evaluation, which takes into account the diversity of research activities, the merits of open science (see link 4 below) and differences in career stages, career paths and disciplines.

### B5.3 — For each initiative, please provide more information, including on the stakeholders[i] that are involved or lead the initiative, and links as relevant.

The Finnish Open Science Coordination annually (since 2019, see the link below) presents several awards to recognize significant contributions to open science. The coordination of these awards is managed by the Federation of Finnish Learned Societies, with funding from the Ministry of Education and Culture. From 2015 to 2017, the Ministry also distributed annual awards for activities promoting research openness as part of the Ministry led Open Science and Research initiative. Also see Q 5.1 on the Finnish development on responsible research assessment. The new assessment models will aim to recognize and reward open science practices.

### B5.4 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

Publication Forum The steering group of the Publication Forum decided on 9.12.2024 to downgrade 271 journals from MDPI and Frontiers to level 0 from the beginning of 2025. The decision is based on the steering group's policy from 30.9.2024 to downgrade grey area journals from MDPI and Frontiers to level 0 from the beginning of 2025, excluding journals the panels suggested to keep at level 1 at their autumn meetings. Based on the panels' suggestions, 16 MDPI and 22 Frontiers journals will remain at level 1 (see link 1 below). Grey area journals make use of the APC (Article Processing Charge) operating model and aim to increase the number of publications with the minimum time spend for editorial work and quality assessment (see link 2 below) Publication Forum expert panels decided to downgrade 60 journals to level 0 from the beginning of 2025 based on the research community's feedback on the quality assessment practices of scientific journals. In the spring of 2024, the Publication Forum collected research community's experiences on defects in quality assessment practices of scientific journals. When reviewing the feedback, the panels discussed the publisher's role in evaluations. Especially, the panels discussed commercial open access publishers, whose business model is based on collecting as many author fees (so called APC fees) as possible (see link 3 below) Publication Forum (in Finnish often referred to as JUFO) is a rating and classification system to support the quality assessment of research output. To account for the different publication cultures characteristic of various disciplines, the classification includes academic journals, book series, conferences as well as book publishers. The four-level classification rates the major foreign and domestic publication channels of all disciplines as follows: 1 = basic level 2 = leading level 3 = highest level 0 = publication channels that don’t meet the criteria for level 1. (see link 4 below) The evaluation is performed by 23 discipline-specific Expert Panels composed of some 300 distinguished Finnish or Finland-based scholars.

## B6 – Engagement of Societal Actors & Open Innovation

### B6.1 — Indicate which of the recommended actions they address

promoting open innovation practices;participatory methods that value inputs from societal actors, e.g. citizen science, crowdsourcing scientific projects

### B6.1 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

	participatory methods that value inputs from societal actors, e.g. citizen science, crowdsourcing scientific projects In Finland, citizen science is included in the policy for open scholarship (see link 1 below). The policy is supported by the Recommendation for citizen science (see link 2 below).  According to national open science monitoring 2024, 57 % of the responding research organisations had a policy on citizen science or a policy was in preparation. Also a number of services and training was available in citizen science. Legal services were offered equally with other projects in 62 % of the organisations, support and advice for general communication in citizen science was available in 57 % of the organisations and for the planning and implementing of citizen science in 43 % of the organisations. For personnel and researchers, participating in citizen science training as a part of other personnel training was possible in 40 % of the organisations (see link 3 below).  	promoting open innovation practices. The national roadmap for RDI (2020–2023, see link 4 below), had an action point that ministries develop the measurement of the effects of value creation related to the data utilisation and promote the opening and use of the data resources of public sector authorities in RDI activities. Also, the opening of public information resources was taken up as a way to create conditions for RDI activities and demand for innovations. In Finland, there is a national network, Innokylä, for innovations in the healthcare and social services area (see link 5 below, in Finnish only). This innovation network is open for all actors in the healthcare and social services in public sector, associations, educational institutes and companies. The network has over 700 members. Its database has 417 entities and over 4,000 operating models. All outputs are openly available and reusable.  The network is coordinated by the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL)  and SOSTE Finnish Federation for Social Affairs and Health (see links 6 and 7 below).  	Others (with a box to add text)  Link 1: https://edition.fi/tsv/catalog/book/227 Link 2: https://edition.fi/tsv/catalog/book/445 Link 3: https://research.fi/en/science-innovation-policy/open-science-and-research-indicators/indicators_content_3  Link 4: https://tem.fi/en/the-national-roadmap-for-rdi Link 5: https://innokyla.fi/fi  Link 6: https://thl.fi/en/main-page Link 7: https://www.soste.fi/en/etusivu/

## B7 – International Cooperation

### B7.1 — How is your country promoting and facilitating international scientific collaborations on open science as outlined in the 2021 Recommendation on Open Science?

Finland is participating in the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), the Research Data Alliance (RDA), International Science Council Committee on Data (CODATA) communities, and European research infrastructure work. ESFRI, the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures, is a strategic instrument to develop the scientific integration of Europe and to strengthen its international outreach. The competitive and open access to high quality Research Infrastructures supports and benchmarks the quality of the activities of European scientists, and attracts the best researchers from around the world.           Finland is participating in European Open Science Cloud Collaboration, for example by connecting the Fairdata services to the EOSC and hosting a national EOSC node (in preparation).           Finland is participating in the works to set up European Digital Infrastructure Consortia (EDICs) for the Genome EDIC, the Mobility and Logistics Data EDIC and Connected Public Administration EDIC (IMPACTS-EDIC). The country is finalising membership negotiations for the Local Digital Twins (LDT –CitiVERSE) EDIC and has decided to seek an observer status in the Alliance for Language Technologies one (ALT-EDIC)2(both already set up). The country also participates in the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking, hosting LUMI, one of the supercomputers procured by the Joint Undertaking.

Declaration for Open Science and Research (Finland) 2020–2025 and its supporting policies The vision of the Declaration for Open Science and Research (Finland) 2020–2025, states: “the Finnish research community is an international forerunner in open science and research” (see link 1 below). In the supporting policies, the policy for Open Scholarship Cooperation (see link 2 below), says in the actions of the first objective: “The organisation utilises national and international cooperation in the development of open science whenever possible and appropriate.” The policy Open Education and Educational Resources (see link 3 below), states in its Objective 3: “By 2025 Finland is known as a pioneer and promoter of open educational resources in higher education.” Participating in international cooperation projects and disseminating information on open educational resources and related practices within the organisations as well as nationally and internationally are mentioned in the actions.  In the area of research data and methods, the policy (see link 4 below), brings up that “Finnish operators actively participate in European and international work, e.g. in the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), the Research Data Alliance (RDA), International Science Council Committee on Data (CODATA) communities, and European research infrastructure work. The Finnish research community participates actively in dialogue where it can support the openness of research and contribute to the establishment of practical solutions in national and international cooperation.” Finnish open science monitoring provides national information required in various international comparisons for open science and research, particularly within Europe. Also, international indicators can be used for monitoring as they evolve and are able to enrich Finnish indicators (the monitoring model is available through link 5 below).
