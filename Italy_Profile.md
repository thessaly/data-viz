## B2 – Open Science Policies and Governance

### B2.1 — Share a machine-readable PDF file of the policy

The National Research Programme (PNR), established under Legislative Decree 204/1998, is the foundational document that guides Italy’s research policies, with its implementation coordinated by the Ministry of University and Research in collaboration with State administrations. On the European and international fronts, the PNR synthesizes the various intervention lines pursued by central and regional public administrations within the national research and innovation system. It effectively integrates diverse initiatives, contributions, and regional specificities, in full compliance with the distribution of regulatory and administrative competencies. The PNR aims to foster greater harmony and enhance the coordination of research policies at European, national, and regional levels, thereby strengthening the presence and competitiveness of Italian researchers both within the European Research Area and on the global stage. The most recent iteration of this plan, covering the period 2021–2027, was approved in December 2020. It is the product of extensive discussions initiated by the Ministry of University and Research with the scientific community and State and regional administrations—and, for the first time, extended through public consultation to stakeholders from both the public and private sectors and civil society. Designed to support the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the priorities of the European Commission, the objectives of the 2021–2027 Cohesion Policy, and the Next Generation EU initiative, the plan represents a comprehensive strategy for advancing Italy’s research landscape. Approximately 250 leading experts from the national scientific community contributed to drafting the document, working alongside the administrative structure of the Directorate-General for the Coordination and Valorization of Research and its Results. The National Plan for Open Science (PNSA) and the National Plan for Research Infrastructures, are both included as key horizontal components of the 2021–2027 PNR. PNSA encompasses all the listed open science elements.

### B2.2 — Please share a machine-readable PDF file(s) of the policy(ies) and provide the following information for each: Title of the policy or legal instrument, the authority in charge of development of the policy, entities involved and the process of development, year of adoption, year of last update, key areas/sections of the policy, elements of open science that are addressed, and links to the webpage(s) if available

The legal framework at the National level for publications [art 4, par 2, 3, 4 law 7 October 2013, n. 112] regulates open access to them. The established mandate is lighter than the one of the European Commission in its funding programmes. Concerning research data, Italy has implemented the 2019 EU Directive on Open Data [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/IT/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019L1024]. Currently, in Italy, the rules on Open Data are regulated by the recent version of Legislative Decree 36/2006, which has been adapted to essentially reflect what is established by the Open Data Directive. The Agency for Digital Italy (AgID) has published specific guidelines to clarify the technical and implementation aspects of the new regulation. Research institutions are implementing these guidelines at different speeds. A similar implementation process is ongoing in organizations involved in the building and maintenance of EU research infrastructure nodes

### B2.3 — Please provide details and links as relevant, including for each instrument: Title of the instrument, its objective, the authority in charge, allocated budget, elements of open science included

Yes, in Italy, there are several policy instruments aimed at promoting open science, aligning with European Union directives and fostering transparency, accessibility, and collaboration in research. Some key instruments include: 1. National Open Science Plan (Piano Nazionale per la Scienza Aperta) - 2023  Approved by the Ministry of University and Research (MUR) in 2023, this plan aligns with EU Open Science policies and the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC).  It establishes guidelines for open access publishing, research data sharing, and FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). 2. National Research Plan (Piano Nazionale della Ricerca - PNR)  The PNR 2021-2027 includes open science as a strategic objective, promoting open access to scientific publications and research data.  It supports infrastructure development for open repositories and encourages the use of open-source software. 3. Italian Open Science Strategy within PNRR  As part of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR), Italy invests in digitalization and research infrastructure, including platforms for open science and open-access repositories.  It funds projects that promote data sharing and interoperability.  For example, all the projects funded in the framework of the “Piano Nazionale di Ripresa e Resilienza (PNRR)” - Next Generation Europe Recovery Funds explicitly require and finance FAIR data management and open science activities. Overall these projects have received 4,3 billion of euro https://www.osservatoriorecovery.it/i-decreti-di-assegnazioni- delle-risorse-pnrr-del-mur-missione-4-componente-2-investimenti-1-4-1-5-3-1/) and involve a large population of researchers and innovation actors. The mandates included in these projects largely contribute to raising awareness of open science and accelerating the transition towards this new approach

### B2.4 — Please provide details and links as relevant, including the name of ministries and national authorities/entities, as well as affiliated organizations that are involved in the development and implementation of the plan, strategy or the roadmap

The National Plan for Open Science (Piano Nazionale per la Scienza Aperta - PNSA) was published in June 2022. It is available at the address https://www.mur.gov.it/it/news/lunedi-20062022/pubblicato-il-piano-nazionale-della-scienza- aperta https://www.mur.gov.it/sites/default/files/2023-01/PNSA_2021-27_ENG.pdf) PNSA is part of the National Plan for Research 2021-2027 developed by the Ministry of Research (MUR). It was prepared with the contribution of a group of selected experts from different disciplines and knowledgeable on different elements of open science. PNSA highlights the need to implement synchronised actions along multiple dimensions: ● General measures – i.e. the priority and preparatory actions to proceed with everything else; ● Regulatory indications – to support the implementation of the plan and the cultural and organizational change towards open science; ● Research results – for the effective and efficient sharing and management of the results of Italian research according to the FAIR principles; ● Research assessment – to support assessment methodologies and practices in line with an open approach to science; ● Infrastructure and services – to provide technological tools suitable for implementing all the plan elements. The set of tools is also expected to constitute the core of what could become the “National Infrastructure Node” of the EOSC federation for the years following 2027. ● Training – to create the skills necessary to achieve the objectives of the PNSA; ● European participation and the European Data Space – to connect to the European panorama and to the emerging initiatives that have the sharing of research products at their core; ● Research - to identify new solutions that natively respond to the need to make research work more effective and efficient as it will be conducted in the near future when open science will be the norm. In March 2023, an expert group was appointed by MUR with the task of preparing an implementation plan by 2027 in line with PNSA. The expert group was also requested to propose processes for identifying existing assets that could be effectively leveraged for its implementation. [https://open- science.it/article?rpk=321298&prs_sel=p_researcher&tpc_sel=t_piano_nazionale_scienza_aper ta] The produced implementation plan involves a joint effort of, among others, academic and research institutions, the National Research Assessment Agency (ANVUR) and the Ministry of University and Research. It also anticipated the contribution of specilised technical companies if needed

### B2.5 — Please provide more information, including the number of policies, name of the institute(s) that has/have developed the policy(s) and elements of open science included in the policy (please consider policies and strategies addressing all elements of open science, including citizen
and participatory  science, or co-production of knowledge with multiple actors).

At least 75 academic and research institutions have adopted an Open Science policy. Currently, most of these policies focus on publications, with nine referencing FAIR Data and six addressing Data Management. By 2025, this number is expected to grow significantly. All 75 policies, along with detailed descriptions, are available in a dedicated section of the open- science.it catalogue. Additionally, some institutions have developed operational work plans to align internal activities and processes with these policies. Notable examples include the National Research Council (CNR): https://zenodo.org/records/7983538, https://iris.cnr.it/handle/20.500.14243/510437) and National Institute of Geology and Vulcanology (INGV ) (https://istituto.ingv.it/it/open-science.html).

### B2.6 — Please provide details and links as relevant

The Ministry of University and Research has allocated specific resources to support the implementation of the National Plan for Open Science.

### B2.7 — Please provide details and links as relevant

As previously mentioned in response to question 2.3, an increasing number of national project funding programs now include mandates for FAIR data management and open science practices. The costs associated with these activities are considered eligible expenses

### B2.8 — Please provide details and links as relevant

Italy is actively promoting equitable public-private partnerships on open science through investments in the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR). By the end of 2025, the PNRR will have allocated significant resources to research and innovation, requiring compliance with open science principles and fostering collaboration between public institutions, universities, and private sector actors. Specifically, the Ministry of University and Research (MUR) has designated 4.3 billion euros to projects that integrate FAIR data management and open-access policies, ensuring that both public and private entities contribute to and benefit from open science practices. These projects are designed to increase knowledge-sharing, enhance research accessibility, and strengthen partnerships in line with the 2021 UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science.

### B2.9 — Please provide details and links as relevant

There is no centralized national monitoring system for Open Science. However, several initiatives aim to track the adoption of Open Science practices in academic institutions and research- performing organizations. These initiatives have largely agreed on a shared set of core indicators while incorporating additional institution-specific metrics.Monitoring efforts rely on open, non-proprietary, and transparent infrastructures provided by research institutions, such as those described at the following addresses: https://services.d4science.org/web/osobservatory_it, https://www.openaccessrepository.it/record/143565) The monitored data are supplied and overseen by designated personnel within the participating institutions. When possible, additional data are gathered through the European OpenAIRE infrastructure (www.openaire.eu).
