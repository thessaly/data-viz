## B1 – Promotion of the UNESCO 2021 Recommendation on Open Science

### B1.1 — If yes, please indicate which ministries and or national authorities/entities have been involved in the promotion of the 2021 Recommendation

Ministry of Higher Education and Science and Technology and BRIN. Both Institution play significant role to advancing 2021 recomendation

### B1.2 — If yes, which language(s)?

Bahasa

### B1.3 — If yes, please provide details on the activities organized or foreseen and links as relevant

Indonesia has demonstrated involvement in open science funding discussions at regional and international levels, although there is no consistency on follow-up. There are challenges in implementation due to the still dominant use of citation-based metrics in research assessment in national regulations, while UNESCO recommendations encourage broader open science practices such as data sharing, collaboration and transparency. Open science has several benefit such as increasing research efficiency, encourage innovation, and strengthen collaboration between researchers. However, without clear regulatory and funding mechanisms, this practice will be difficult to develop. Example : 1.	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/bip/article/view/17054 2.	https://www.csis.or.id/publication/a-case-for-open-science-in-indonesia-advancing-digital-literacy-scientific-infrastructure-and-leadership/ 3.	RINarxiv preprint service 4.	Open Science Meeting, Open Science Webinar 5.	Blogpost, Science Watch Dog,

### B1.4 — If yes, please indicate the actions that are taken to incorporate the specific values and principles. For each case, please provide details and links as relevant

In several Collaborative Research and Innovation Funding for Advanced Indonesia (RIIM) schemes, organized by BRIN and LPDP, the implementation of open science has been encouraged. Link :  https://pendanaan-risnov.brin.go.id/program/eyJpdiI6IldRSk9KdmthOW1YdkxlN1o3RjIzR3c9PSIsInZhbHVlIjoiS2p5VDBrVnZWdUlwTzk4Rkdicmpydz09IiwibWFjIjoiYzA1NTYwMWQzNmI1NWQwNDk2MjI1MWI0ZmZjNjllYzRlYWQwZmQ2ZmI1M2RmNDBjODUzZDRkNmZlZWEzYjg3OSIsInRhZyI6IiJ9; Wikimedia Indonesia, through the Wikidata Indonesia program, organizes training and outreach that introduces the principles of Open Linked Data, open data sources and Wikidata. Documentation available at https://id.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikidata_2024/Dokumentasi_aktivitas; However, it must be acknowledged that no concrete program has been planned or implemented by stakeholders with full awareness to fulfill UNESCO's recommendations. Here the difficulty arises, when someone takes the initiative, there will always be a response that so far various efforts have been made in line with UNESCO recommendations.    Consolidation efforts are still needed to equalize perceptions and unite concrete steps for implementing Open Science in Indonesia.

## B2 – Open Science Policies and Governance

### B2.3 — Please provide details and links as relevant, including for each instrument: Title of the instrument, its objective, the authority in charge, allocated budget, elements of open science included

Majority of policy instruments are still focused on aspects of open access publications, especially those related to the management and development of open access journals. Although this is a positive step in supporting the dissemination of scientific knowledge, the scope of this policy is still limited and does not fully reflect the full spectrum of open science practices recommended by UNESCO.

### B2.4 — Please provide details and links as relevant, including the name of ministries and national authorities/entities, as well as affiliated organizations that are involved in the development and implementation of the plan, strategy or the roadmap

Although there are several programs that have been implemented currently, such as ELSA and RIN (open scientific services for public provided by National Research and Innovation Agency) for storing and sharing research data, there is still no visible development of new programs that comprehensively lead to the implementation of the UNESCO Recommendations on Open Science. Existing programs, although making positive contributions, are still limited in scope and have not fully adopted the open science principles recommended by UNESCO.

### B2.5 — Please provide more information, including the number of policies, name of the institute(s) that has/have developed the policy(s) and elements of open science included in the policy (please consider policies and strategies addressing all elements of open science, including citizen
and participatory  science, or co-production of knowledge with multiple actors).

BRIN has an open platform policy that opens up access to infrastructure, funding and resources to carry out research and collaboration between various parties from universities, BRIN and industry.

### B2.7 — Please provide details and links as relevant

Creative Commons Indonesia  (CCID) in implementing the Open Learning Resources (OER) project in (2024-2025) received funding support from the Wikimedia Foundation. This SPT project began by holding an SPT collaboration forum in September 2024. At the forum, various types of SPT collaboration actions were agreed, namely:  ● SPT online campaign which is participated in by almost all SPT forum participants via Instagram which will be held from October 2024 – April 2025. For the campaign theme in March, we will carry the theme of open science. (online campaign link) ● Teaching material illustration contest (KIBA) held in October - November 2024 with CCID and the Gimpscape community and supported by Seameo Seamolec, an Indonesian learning teacher community. From this contest, 257 illustrations of teaching materials were obtained from 16 participants.  ● The talk show and editathon for Science Teaching Materials on the Internet which will be held on 5-6 December 2024 is a collaboration between BBGP West Java and Wikimedia Indonesia. This event was attended by 36 teachers with a science education background at secondary school level. All participants successfully uploaded at least one work to Commons and curated science illustrations available on Wikimedia Commons. These science illustrations, which can be used as teaching materials, are classified as OER and are now available for other science educators in Indonesia to use. (The results of curation of science teaching materials by educators can be accessed here) ● Open learning source online training in December 2024 - May 31 2025. This training is supported by LMS from SEAMEO SEAMOLEC with a total of 497 participants who are educators.

### B3.3 — Please provide more information and links as relevant, and indicate to which open science actors in your country those networks are accessible

The Indonesian Research and Education Networks (IDREN) is a special network infrastructure that connects research and education institutions and communities in Indonesia. This network is dedicated to the data communications connectivity needed to enable a community of researchers, academics and developers to collaborate together.  The IDREN network infrastructure was realized thanks to support and collaboration between the telecommunications industry community (network operators, internet service providers) which manages connectivity up to layer two (physical) and the research and education community which manages connectivity at layer three (network), as well as support for connectivity to global REN. Here is the link : https://idren.id/

### B3.4 — For each infrastructure, please provide links as relevant and more information with regard to their compliance with the 2021 Recommendation on Open Science in terms of inclusivity, accessibility, interoperability, community governance, FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) and CARE (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility and Ethics) principles.

## B4 – Education, Capacity Building & Science Communication

### B4.1 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so.

There is no systematic capacity building program for policy makers. This is caused by limited understanding by policy makers regarding the concept and benefits of open science, as well as a lack of awareness of the importance of integrating open science principles into national Science Technology and Innovation policies. This limited insight is reflected in the lack of policy initiatives that explicitly support the implementation of open science practices at various levels.

### B4.2 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so.

### B4.3 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so.

Although the WIBISANA initiative of the Indonesian Open Science Community was launched five years ago and provides a comprehensive learning platform to introduce open science practices, to date there has been no systematic effort at the institutional or national level to integrate and develop open science components into the higher education curriculum. This lack of formal integration indicates a significant gap between the availability of learning resources and their implementation in the higher education system.

## B5 – Research Assessment and Incentives

### B5.1 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so.

The majority, if not all, of the assessment and evaluation systems currently implemented still rely heavily on mainstream metrics such as the number of citations and journal impact factors. This approach focusing on quantitative metrics represents a significant gap with UNESCO recommendations, which encourage the use of more comprehensive and diverse assessment indicators. Current evaluation systems tend to ignore important aspects of open science practices such as sharing research data, cross-disciplinary collaboration and engagement with society, which are key elements in UNESCO's recommendations on open science

### B5.2 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so.

Although BRIN has implemented several important programs such as ELSA and RIN (National Scientific Repository), open science initiatives at the government level are still very limited. The Ministry of Education and Technology, as one of the main stakeholders in the national research ecosystem, has not initiated significant programs in this context. What is more concerning is that most existing activities are still focused on downstream aspects of the research cycle, especially on open access publications, while other important aspects of open science such as data sharing, open methodology and collaboration have not received sufficient attention.

### B5.3 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so.

The Indonesian government has not developed a comprehensive reward system for open science initiatives. Although there are several programs supporting open science practices, the majority of existing initiatives are still limited to downstream aspects of the research process, particularly in the form of open access publications. Even in the context of these publications, the focus of evaluation and awards is more on citation-based measurements than on the quality of the content or substantive contribution of the research. This reflects the gap between prevailing evaluation practices and the spirit of open science which emphasizes transparency, accessibility and social impact of scientific research.

### B5.4 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

Until now, several concerns that often arise in discussions about open science have not been supported by strong arguments and sufficient empirical evidence. These concerns include several main aspects: First, there is a fear that when research results are freely disclosed, the work will be vulnerable to acts of plagiarism by other parties. Second, there is concern that the research results that are disclosed can easily be exploited commercially by parties who do not contribute to the research process. Third, there is concern that research results that are disseminated have the potential to be "stolen" and developed into commercial products without proper attribution to the original researchers. Finally, there is an opinion that research results that have been made public will face difficulties in the formal publication process because they can be considered duplication or even categorized as self-plagiarism by scientific journals. All of these concerns, while understandable from the perspective of individual researchers, are often unsupported by substantial evidence and tend to ignore the larger benefits of open science practices for the scientific community as a whole

## B7 – International Cooperation

### B7.1 — How is your country promoting and facilitating international scientific collaborations on open science as outlined in the 2021 Recommendation on Open Science?

the implementation of international scientific collaboration in the context of open science in Indonesia has not been seen in a systematic and structured manner at the institutional or national level involving various institutions in an integrated manner. Although there are several efforts that should be appreciated, most activities are still limited to initiatives from small groups spread across various institutions, such as research teams in universities, research units within national research institutions (for example BRIN), non-governmental organizations that focus on research, and media platforms that have special attention to the dissemination of scientific knowledge (such as The Conversation). These initiatives, while valuable, remain sporadic and have not been coordinated within a cohesive national framework to support open science.

### B7.2 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

Indonesia has demonstrated a commitment to promoting scientific collaboration at both national and international levels, which is implemented through various programs such as Indonesian Collaborative Research and International Collaborative Research. These programs are designed to encourage cross-institutional and cross-country research collaboration, with the aim of improving the quality and impact of Indonesian research on the global stage. However, there is a gap between the implementation of these programs and UNESCO's recommendations on open science, especially in terms of the evaluation metrics used. The academic guidelines that these programs refer to still rely heavily on mainstream metrics such as number of citations and journal impact factors, an approach that runs counter to the principles outlined in the UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science, which instead encourages the use of more diverse and inclusive evaluation metrics

### B7.3 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

Several meetings and discussions about open science funding have taken place, but there has been no consistent follow-up. As can be seen from the various sources above, open science requires sustainable policy support and funding to be implemented effectively. Without clear regulatory and funding mechanisms, open science practices will be difficult to develop despite their proven benefits in increasing research efficiency, collaboration and innovation.

## B8 – Other

### B8.1 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

Regulations that are heavy on mainstream metrics (citation based) that are not directly or indirectly related to the UNESCO recommendations. This is reflected in the still dominant use of citation metrics in research assessment (explicitly stated in the regulations on career assessment and research performance assessment published by the ministry), while UNESCO encourages broader open science practices such as data sharing, collaboration and transparency. As shown in various studies, excessive focus on citation metrics can hinder innovation and collaboration in research. In fact, open science has been proven to increase research efficiency, encourage more innovative solutions, and strengthen collaboration between researchers.
