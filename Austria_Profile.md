With this policy, Austria demonstrates its strong commitment to the Open Science movement and the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC). The Austrian Open Science Policy is based on international open science principles as recommended by the Open Science Policy Platform, a group of experts that supports and advises the European Commission in developing strategies and implementing the European Agenda for Open Science in practice (https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/strategy/strategy-research-and-innovation/our-digital-future/open-science_en#the-eus-open-science-policy). The national policy also considers the 2021 UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science. The Austrian Open Science Policy is available in the downloads section at: https://www.bmfwf.gv.at/wissenschaft/leitthemen/digitalisierung/open-science/open-science-policy-austria.html

### B2.5 — Please provide more information, including the number of policies, name of the institute(s) that has/have developed the policy(s) and elements of open science included in the policy (please consider policies and strategies addressing all elements of open science, including citizen
and participatory  science, or co-production of knowledge with multiple actors).

In Austria, various approaches are being pursued to promote Open Science at the institutional level. Some examples include: (1) Research data management: 11 universities in Austria have policies for research data management in place, encouraging various open science practices and the adoption of the FAIR principles: Medical Universities of Graz, Innsbruck, Vienna; Graz University of Technology; TU Wien; Universities of Linz, Graz, Innsbruck, Vienna; University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna; Vienna University of Economics and Business. Policy example: https://rdm.univie.ac.at/rdm-policy-and-faq/. (2) Open Access: Several universities have developed open access policies. Policy example: https://openaccess.univie.ac.at/en/oa-basics/university-of-vienna-oa-policy/. Furthermore, the university libraries of the universities of Vienna, Graz, Innsbruck and Klagenfurt have set up open access repositories. In addition, the University of Vienna, for example, has negotiated six open access agreements at the institutional level: https://openaccess.univie.ac.at/en/funding/oa-publishing-agreements/. (3) Open educational resources (OER): The universities of Vienna, Graz, Innsbruck and Graz University of Technology have set up OER repositories in addition to OER policies. The University of Vienna has also launched the OERhub, a platform that bundles open educational resources from several Austrian repositories: https://oerhub.at/en. OER policy example: https://oer.univie.ac.at/oer-policy-der-universitaet-wien/. Additionally, the University College of Teacher Education Lower Austria, has developed guidelines for creating and using OER: Open Educational Resources Policy | Pädagogische Hochschule Niederösterreich. Forum New Media Austria (FNMA) has prepared “Recommendations for the Integration of Open Educational Resources at Universities in Austria”: https://fnma.at/. The project "Open Education Austria" for the joint development of a national OER infrastructure has published a guideline for the creation of OER, which includes the definition of OER according to UNESCO’s 2019 Recommendation: https://oer-portal.uni-graz.at/edu-sharing/components/render/58f36d33-3cef-4631-a2cf-617b864efde9. The Federal Ministry responsible for science and research also provides for the expansion of shared OER services in the higher education sector. In the current period of the performance agreements (2025-2027) with all public universities, the ministry has therefore anchored the development of an open, trustworthy digital infrastructure through the further development of and participation in national shared services for OER/MOOCs and the expansion of the range of interactive teaching materials for self-study. (4) Stakeholder platforms: The Austrian University Conference (uniko) has set up the interdisciplinary stakeholder platform Open Science Austria (OSA), which is dedicated to information and dissemination, coordination and networking as well as the development of recommendations and guidelines in the areas of Open Science: https://www.osa-openscienceaustria.at/en/. (5) Citizen Science: The Citizen Science Network Austria, with the associated online platform "Österreich forscht", is a network of institutions supporting the establishment and promotion of citizen science in Austria: https://www.citizen-science.at/en/.

### B4.3 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so.

Austria is actively promoting open science through various initiatives, including the development of an Open Science Policy by the Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research (cf. 2.2). This policy aims to foster a culture of openness and transparency in scientific research. In the realm of higher education, institutions like the University of Innsbruck are integrating open science principles into their strategic plans. The university’s development plan for 2025 emphasises the importance of Open Research and the enhancement of research infrastructures, reflecting a commitment to open science practices. Additionally, Austria is advancing digital competencies through the Digital Skills Initiative, which includes the introduction of a national competence framework for digital skills: https://www.digitalaustria.gv.at/kompetenzen/strategien.html (in German). While this framework primarily focuses on digital literacy, it complements the broader objectives of Open Science by promoting skills essential for digital research and collaboration. Furthermore, efforts are underway to develop an Austrian Open Educational Resources (OER) certification for higher education institutions and their employees (https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-658-38703-7_9#DOI). This certification aligns with the digi.kompP model, which encompasses competencies related to creating digital materials, including aspects of open data and copyright. The development of the digi.kompP model was coordinated by the Virtual University College of Teacher Education on behalf of the Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research in 2016 and has subsequently been revised to incorporate recent developments. While these initiatives indicate a strong movement towards incorporating open science competencies into higher education curricula, specific information regarding a standardised framework for open science competencies within research skills curricula across all Austrian higher education institutions by 2025 is not readily available. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, it would be advisable to consult official communications from the relevant ministry or individual universities’ strategic plans.

### B4.5 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

The Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research launched the “DNAustria” initiative in 2024. It is intended to increase the visibility of science and democracy education programmes in Austria by providing a central information platform, “Entdecke.DNAustria” (“Discover DNAustria”). The platform enables the public to find various science and democracy education programmes across all Austrian federal states: https://dnaustria.at/ (in German). In addition, Austria’s largest science communication centre will be built in Vienna by 2027. The Vienna Principles, a vision paper from 2016, developed by the OANA network (Open Access Network Austria), represents a framework for the future of scholarly communication. Principle 6, “Understandability”, for instance, calls for scholarly communication to be adapted for different stakeholder groups inside and outside of academia, making this communication more meaningful and allowing for further involvement and participation. Link: https://viennaprinciples.org/. The University of Innsbruck has published a position paper on open science communication: https://www.uibk.ac.at/de/public-relations/kommunikation/open-science-communication/. Additionally, several civil society organisations and research/higher education institutions in Austria promote a better understanding of science and the scientific process for scientific knowledge to (re-)gain significance for public discourse and decision-making. Examples: (1) The Austrian non-profit adult education institutions register over two million participants per year. More than 200,000 people attend courses and individual events offered by Austrian adult education centres in science, technology and the environment – including Open Science-related courses and events – or in politics, society and culture every year: https://www.vhs.or.at/english. (2) Initiated by the Austrian Academy of Sciences, the youth science communication initiative “FAEKT! – science communication for the next generation” connects scientists with young people. Activities include (a) the production of videos on quality-controlled research projects, (b) engaging content on YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok, crossing the bridge between science and entertainment, and (c) providing supplementary materials for teachers and students aligned with the secondary school curriculum: https://www.oeaw.ac.at/en/funding/funding-programmes/subsites/trust-science-communication. (3) The non-profit association “Diskurs. Das Wissenschaftsnetz” was founded in 2019 by scientists based in Austria. As an interface between scientific knowledge and mass media, “Diskurs. Das Wissenschaftsnetz” strengthens Open Science by making research findings widely accessible. Building on an extensive network of scientists, it regularly organises (online) press conferences and publishes press releases in which scientists from universities and other research institutions present new evidence on a broad range of topics: https://www.diskurs-wissenschaftsnetz.at/ (in German). (4) To increase the visibility and dissemination of scientific knowledge at the local level, the University of Graz initiated diverse off-campus projects and formats. Among these projects was a pop-up store in the city centre in 2022, where more than 150 science communication events with over 2,500 visitors were held. Other projects targeted more specific audiences, bridging their interests with science communication, e.g. “Science meets Poetry” in the House of Literature (“Literaturhaus Graz”) or “Science & Cinema” in a public movie theatre. The Center for Society, Knowledge and Communication is dedicated to science communication and societal engagement and forms an umbrella organization for various science communication offers: https://sieben.uni-graz.at/de/ (in German)

## B5 – Research Assessment and Incentives

### B5.1 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

A study commissioned by Open Science Austria (OSA) found in 2024 that open science practices to date are only marginally considered within the appointment process of new professors at Austrian higher education institutions: https://ucrisportal.univie.ac.at/de/publications/quality-assessment-in-berufungsprozessen-an-higher-education-inst (in German). In response, Open Science Austria founded the Research Assessment (II) working group in December 2024, which is working on evaluation criteria until autumn 2026 and will also issue national recommendations by then. Initial results will be presented at the Open Science Festival 2025 at the University of Vienna. Results (i.e. recommendations) of the working group on career paths in science and research assessment (ERA Action 3 and 4) of the Austrian University Conference from 2022-2024 are available at: https://www.uniko.ac.at/modules/download.php?key=33349_DE_O&f=2&jt=7906&cs=F43B. At the level of individual higher education institutions, for example, the University of Vienna’s “Concepts on Evaluating Research Activities and Publications” already include clear recommendations to publish open access and to use persistent identifiers like DOI and ORCID iD: https://www.qs.univie.ac.at/en/analyses/evaluation-concepts/. Furthermore, several Austrian higher education and research institutions have joined CoARA (https://coara.eu/agreement/signatories/?category%5B0%5D=austria#signatories).

### B5.2 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

While open science practices have not yet been widely incorporated into the career evaluation and progression systems at the institutional level (cf. 5.1), there are initiatives at the national and institutional level to move in that direction: Through the performance agreements recently negotiated with them, Austrian public universities have been encouraged to widen their assessment criteria and thereby also consider signing the CoARA agreement. The CoARA agreement explicitly states the relevance of open science practices, and some higher education and research institutions in Austria have already signed it. In addition, the Open Science Austria (OSA) working group Research Assessment (II) is currently comparing and analysing national assessment criteria to which open science practices belong. The “Final report and recommendations of the Austrian Higher Education Conference Working Group on careers in research in the context of the European Research Area”, published in 2024, also calls upon all actors within the Austrian Higher Education and Research Area to engage in and value activities concerning open science: https://www.uniko.ac.at/modules/download.php?key=33349_DE_O&f=2&jt=7906&cs=F43B

### B5.3 — For each initiative, please provide more information, including on the stakeholders[i] that are involved or lead the initiative, and links as relevant.

In Austria, several funding opportunities recognise and reward open science practices (cf. 2.6, 2.7), for example the “Sparkling Science” research funding programme. The programme promotes collaboration between research institutions, schools and society to generate innovative scientific outcomes (https://oead.at/en/study-research-teaching/citizen-science/sparkling-science). Central to its goals is the opening-up of research and innovation processes towards maximally transparent and participatory working approaches as well as free access to research results and data sets. “Sparkling Science” is funded by the Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research and is coordinated by the Agency for Education and Internationalisation (OeAD). For “Sparkling Science 2.0”, which started in 2021 and for which there is a special directive (“Sonderrichtlinie”) until 2026, calls are planned every two years, with the next one presumably opening in 2025.

### B5.4 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

While Austria has been proactive in promoting open science through policies like the Open Science Policy Austria, there is limited specific documentation on unintended negative consequences within the country. However, broader discussions highlight potential challenges associated with open science practices that could be relevant to Austria: (1) Legal and Copyright Issues: Implementing open access strategies necessitates careful navigation of legal frameworks, particularly concerning copyright laws. Authors and repository operators in Austria must consider various legal provisions when making documents publicly accessible. For instance, while many publishers permit self-archiving, they often impose conditions such as embargo periods between the publication date and open online access. This underscores the importance of understanding and adhering to copyright regulations to avoid legal complications. (2) Equity and Inclusion Concerns: Open Science aims to democratise access to research, but if not implemented thoughtfully, it may inadvertently exacerbate existing inequities. For example, the "author-pays" model of open access can be exclusionary, potentially limiting participation from researchers or institutions with fewer financial resources. This dynamic can lead to stratifications in publishing, where only well-funded researchers can afford to publish openly, thereby reinforcing existing disparities. (3) Quality and Reproducibility Challenges: The push for openness must be balanced with maintaining research quality. Without rigorous peer review and quality control mechanisms, there is a risk of disseminating unverified or low-quality research. Moreover, while open science promotes transparency, it also necessitates robust frameworks to ensure that shared data and methodologies are reproducible and reliable. Addressing these challenges is crucial to prevent a potential crisis of trust in scientific research. (4) Foreign Interference: The OSA Steering Board is currently working on the topic of foreign interference and open data at Austrian universities. (5) Predatory publishing: Predatory publishing is an issue of considerable concern for academic institutions in Austria. The project AT2OA² (2021-2024) contained a subproject on predatory publishing, the first of its kind globally. As part of the project, a community of practice, “wissKomm”, was developed. Today, "wissKomm" is the leading voice on matters of predatory practices and quality in scholarly open access publishing for librarians and research staff in German-speaking countries: https://in-transition.at/

## B6 – Engagement of Societal Actors & Open Innovation

### B6.1 — Indicate which of the recommended actions they address

promotion of pre-prints;exploration of open peer-review practices; valuing and sharing of negative scientific results and associated data;participatory methods that value inputs from societal actors, e.g. citizen science, crowdsourcing scientific projects;development of participatory strategies for identifying the needs of marginalized communities and highlighting socially relevant issues to be incorporated into research agendas;promoting open innovation practices

### B6.1 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

At national level, Austria has supported the use of pre-print servers for early dissemination of research, encouraging rapid sharing of findings before formal peer review. This helps make research more accessible and transparent. For example, Austria participates in the arXiv and bioRxiv networks, where Austrian researchers are encouraged to upload their pre-prints. In December 2024, the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) and nine other leading European research funding organisations signed a Statement of Intent to jointly support and further develop the Open Research Europe (ORE) publication platform: https://zenodo.org/records/14624287. Some national funding bodies encourage open peer-review practices, including open comments and transparent reviewer identities, to enhance transparency and accountability in scientific publishing. Austrian initiatives promote the open sharing of negative results to avoid publication bias and increase the value of all scientific findings. Platforms like the Open Science Framework (OSF) and Open Research Europe facilitate this practice. An Open Innovation Strategy for Austria was drawn up in 2016 in a broad-based participatory process. The strategy provides an analysis of the national and international status quo on open innovation while providing a vision for 2025 and concrete measures to carry out. Measure 12 of the Open Innovation Strategy tackles how to embed open data and open access principles in research: https://openinnovation.gv.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/OI_Barrierefrei_Englisch.pdf. Additionally, Austria is implementing the European Council Recommendation on the Guiding principles for knowledge valorisation with its respective Codes of practice – Code of practice on citizen-engagement (2024) and Code of practice on industry-academia co-creation for knowledge valorisation (2024). Furthermore, open innovation is supported through funding programs that encourage collaborations between researchers, industry, and society. At institutional level, several universities actively promote participatory research methods, including citizen science and crowdsourcing scientific projects. The Citizen Science Network Austria initiative supports crowdsourced data collection and public participation in various scientific projects. The ”Sparkling Science 2.0” programme encourages participatory research by integrating citizen science approaches since 2021. The initiative fosters national as well as international collaborations between research institutions, schools, and society, enabling students and citizens to actively participate in scientific processes. The funding programme has also helped to build networks and working groups in which topics such as the engagement with hard-to-reach groups or the culture of error in (citizen) science are examined more closely. Results from these collaborations and discussions are public events and publications, e.g. https://pos.sissa.it/393/007/pdf. Some Austrian research institutions, in collaboration with local communities, explore participatory strategies for addressing the needs of marginalised groups and incorporating socially relevant issues into research agendas. Austrian higher education and research institutions also experiment with open peer review and engage with open innovation, ensuring that research is not only open but also incorporates diverse societal inputs and collaboration across disciplines. These efforts at both the national and institutional levels are designed to foster a more open, inclusive, and transparent scientific process, ensuring that research is accessible, participatory, and socially relevant.

## B7 – International Cooperation

### B7.1 — How is your country promoting and facilitating international scientific collaborations on open science as outlined in the 2021 Recommendation on Open Science?

Austria actively participates in the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), which offers funding opportunities that support Austrian researchers in aligning their research with European open science standards. This fosters collaboration and the development of shared infrastructures. Website: https://eosc-austria.at. Additionally, Austria is a member of several European and international research infrastructures. The Austrian Research Infrastructure Action Plan 2030 (“Österreichischer Forschungsinfrastruktur-Aktionsplan 2030”) provides more details on these memberships. The plan is available for download on the website of the Federal Ministry responsible for science and research at: https://www.bmfwf.gv.at/forschung/forschung-oesterreich/forschungsinfrastruktur.html (in German)
