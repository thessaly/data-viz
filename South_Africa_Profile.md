## B8: Other / Additional Comments

### B8.1: Additional observations on open science implementation
● General by-in from the Academic community
● Shifting of responsibilities by all the stakeholders involved
● Financial constraints
● Colonial history which has influences how research, science and the academic
enterprise is conducted
● Academic Libraries should be given the opportunity to lead this in their respective
institution and to influence the national strategy.
● General lack of available national research funding to support Open Science and Open
Access publications.
● Country more geared towards saving money and making Open Science fund-sourcing
a problem of the researchers themselves.
