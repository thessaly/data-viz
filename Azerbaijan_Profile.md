## B1 – Promotion of the UNESCO 2021 Recommendation on Open Science

### B1.1 — If yes, please indicate which ministries and or national authorities/entities have been involved in the promotion of the 2021 Recommendation

Although the relevant government agencies, ministries, and their research and i academic institutions have access to the proposed Recommendations on the concept of Open Science, the mentioned Recommendation document has not been explicitly shared with state institutions and scientifıc organizations

### B1.2 — If yes, which language(s)?

No

### B1.3 — If yes, please provide details on the activities organized or foreseen and links as relevant

In Azerbaijan, numerous awareness-raising activities have been held on open science in accordance with the 16f, 16g, and 16h paragraphs of the Recommendation. While policy administrators and scientists are informed about open science collaboration, the general public has limited awareness about it. The private sector alsa lacks sufficient knowledge on open science collaboration; however, it has a certain share in the funding of science in Azerbaijan. Taking the mentioned points into account, Higher Education lnstitutions (HEls)· and research institutes under the Ministry of Science and Education of the Republic of Azerbaijan (MoSE), have called on the scientifıc community to share their research fındings with the public. In 2025, relevant bodies of the Ministry of Science and Education of the Republic of Azerbaijan aim to promote the importance of the principles and benefıts of open science

### B1.4 — If yes, please indicate the actions that are taken to incorporate the specific values and principles. For each case, please provide details and links as relevant

Relevant activities have been and are being carried out within the framework of a "Roadmap for lmprovement of the international rating indicators related to scientifıc publications (H-index)," under the leadership of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Azerbaijan: • On January 15, 2020, the lnstitute of Education (loE) hosted an Open Science Workshop conducted by international experts. The workshop brought together 60 participants from different public and private universities, including regional ones, the lnstitute of Education and lntellectual Property Agency, targeting mainly science departments, sectors dealing with scientifıc publications in HEls, and library experts. • On May 5, 2023, the lnstitute of Physics under the Ministry of Science and Education of the Republic of Azerbaijan held a seminar on "Open Science." Participants were provided with detailed information on the ground principles of open science, as well as existing achievements and challenges in this fıeld. • On October 31, 2024, the Azerbaijan Society of Young Scientists, Postgraduates, and Masters, with the support of the Ministry of Youth and Sports, organized a ' meeting in Lankaran city, the "Youth Capital" of 2024, as part of the project "Open Science Summer School for Young Researchers." During the event, young researchers were informed about access to open scientific resources, methods for effectively using research databases, methods for preparing scientifıc articles, and open educational resources through various presentations. HEls are also actively working in this direction: • On 9 February 2022, Baku State University (BSU) with the support of the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Azerbaijan and Azerbaijan Young Scientists·, Post Graduates and Masters Union (AYSPMU) hosted the workshop "Open Science Azerbaijan: Promotion of the Open Science platform among young researchers" within the framework of the Open Science Azerbaijan project. The main goal of the project was to inform young researchers about Open Science, Open Access, Open Research Date, Open lnnovation, Open Research Computatiqn, ResearchGate, Scientific Social Network. ı • On February 17, 2022, Azerbaijan University of Languages hosted a seminar on "Open Science Azerbaijan: Promoting the Open Science Platform Among Young Researchers" with joint support from the "Open Science Azerbaijan" project. • On February 28, 2022, Azerbaijan University of Technoloqy, the Ministry of Education and the Azerbaijan Society of Young Scientists, ıostgraduates, and Masters jointly organized a seminar, as part of the project "Open Science Azerbaijan: Promoting the Open Science Platform Among Yourg Researchers.' • On December 6, 2024, the event titled "Open Access and Science Diplomacy" was held within the framework of the "Erasmus+ KA2" program's "Development of Research Potential through the lnstitutional Repositories Network in Azerbaijan" (DIRNA) project at Azerbaijan Technical University. • On December 23, 2024, the international Open Science and Education Laboratory was opened under the Pedagogy Department at Baku State University (BSU).

## B2 – Open Science Policies and Governance

### B2.1 — Share a machine-readable PDF file of the policy

The elements of open science are reflected in the relevant dbcuments, including the Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan "On Science,". adopted i~ 2016. Additionally, the "Roadmap for lmprovement of the international rating indicators related to scientific publications (H-index)"2 has been developed. The roadmap has fıve objectives, such as integration into the global scientifıc space, strengthening scientifıc intellectual potential, formation of incentive mechanisms, defıning clear targets and evaluation policies for state scientifıc research and aligning scientifıc publications with international standards / Under these fıve objectives, a total of o5 activities have been carried out in 17 areas in 2023. As part of the necessary measures taken for the implementation of relevant proposals on the centralized funding of access to international scientifıc databases for science and higher education institutions, more than 100 science and education institutions have gained access to the Scopus and Science Direct databases, as well as the Web of Science scientometric database, and have been informed accordingly. In 2024, the number of publications by Azerbaijani scientists in journals indexed in the Scopus scientometric database, owned by Elsevier, increased by nearly 40% compared to the previous year and amounted to 4.088 publications. Additionally, with the support of the State Agency for Science and Education (SASHE), Elsevier and Clarivate carried out this fır5ıt-ever joint training program in scientometrics.

Ona legal basis, the Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan "On Science," adopted in 2016, defınes the principles, goals, and priorities of state policy in the fıeld of scientifıc activity. According to this document, the values and principles of sclence in Azerbaijan align with those outlined in the 2021 UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science. State-funded scientifıc research is open to the public and is primarily fınanced by the Science Fund. According to Article 6.0.32 of the Law "On Science," it is the duty of the state of Azerbaijan to prevent the development and application of scientifıc technologies that contradict humanism, endanger human life, disrupt societal stability, threaten national security, or harm ecological balance. This fully complies with the directions stated in Article 8 of the UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science which proposes open access to scientifıc knowledge, with access restrictions allowed only for legitimate reasons such as protecting human rights, privacy, intellectual property, and sensitive data. The official larıquaqe of the Republic of Azerbaijan is Azerbaijani language. However, multilingualism in the practice of science, in scientifıc publications, and in academic communications is encouraged, as scientifıc research in the country is conducted in Azerbaijani, English, and Russian. it is a mandatory requirement that abstracts for obtaining scientific degrees be prepared in three languages (Azerbaijani, English, and Russian).

Univ6rsity of Economics (UNEC). Within the framework of this project, research equiplent, research trips for UNEC's scientists, and the expenses of three joint conferences were fınanced by the company. • Companies such as "Elroys" LLC and "lselTexno" LLC are closely collaborating with the lnstitute of Chemistry of Additives after Academician A.M.Guliyev in this fıeld. A signifıcant result of the collaboration with "Elroys" LLC is the creation and application of the "Depressator AKI" additive. This additive is one of the most successful applied works of the lnstitute. it ensures the transportation of high paraffin oil from Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan through the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline over long distances by lowering their freezing point and dynamic viscosity. With the fınancial support of "Elroys" LLC, its production is now organized at the "Additive" Scientifıc Production Union, and it is being successfully used.
