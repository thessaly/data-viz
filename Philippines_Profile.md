1. The Technology Transfer Act of 2009 (Republic Act No. 10055)  is considered a key policy instrument for promoting open science in the Philippines because it facilitates the dissemination and commercialization of research outputs generated by publicly funded research and development (R&D) activities. The law encourages transparency, collaboration, and sharing of research results by mandating that intellectual property rights from government-funded research be owned by the research institutions rather than the state. This framework promotes open access to scientific innovations while allowing researchers and institutions to engage with industry and other stakeholders for commercialization purposes. The Act also ensures that the benefits of publicly funded research are accessible to a wider audience, aligning with the principles of open science by fostering knowledge sharing, innovation, and broader societal impact.  (https://www.dost.gov.ph/knowledge-resources/2014-04-27-01-59-53/republic-acts/file/288-republic-act-no-10055-philippine-technology-transfer-act-of-2009.html) 2. The Philippine Innovation Act (Republic Act No. 11293)  promotes open science through collaborative research, sharing of scientific data and knowledge, and the encouragement of partnerships between the academe, government, and industry. The law aims to strengthen the country’s innovation governance system through fostering a culture of innovation across all sectors, enhancing productivity, and improving competitiveness. The National Innovation Council (NIC), chaired by the President of the Philippines with the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) as its secretariat, is the primary authority responsible for implementing the law. The NIC oversees the formulation and implementation of the National Innovation Agenda and Strategy Document (NIASD), which outlines the country’s innovation goals and priorities. 3. The Philippine Space Agency (PhilSA) (Republic Act No. 11363)  promotes open science through its initiatives focused on transparency, accessibility, and collaboration in space research and data sharing. PhilSA actively works to make space science and satellite data accessible to government agencies, academic institutions, and the public to support research, policy-making, and development initiatives, especially in areas such as disaster risk reduction, environmental monitoring, and agricultural productivity. ( https://philsa.gov.ph/philippine-space-act/) 4. The Philippine Ecosystem and Natural Capital Accounting System (PENCAS) Act (Republic Act No. 11995) also demonstrates elements of open science by promoting transparency, accessibility, and the collaborative use of environmental and economic data. PENCAS institutionalizes the systematic collection, analysis, and dissemination of natural capital accounts. These accounts help inform evidence-based policymaking, sustainable development, and resource management by making data accessible to researchers, policymakers, and the public.   The Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) serves as the lead authority in implementing PENCAS. https://faolex.fao.org/docs/pdf/phi228431.pdf; 5. The Philippine National Health Research System (PNHRS) Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10532) is a law that established the PNHRS as a framework anchored on the principles of Essential National Health Research on inclusiveness, participation, quality, equity, efficiency and effectiveness, which connect to, and converge with, the wider health, economic, political, educational and S&T systems of the country.
