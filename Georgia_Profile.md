Georgia, though not always in the spotlight for leading large-scale open science initiatives, is involved in several North-South, North-South-South, and South-South collaborations related to scientific research and infrastructure optimization. These collaborations often focus on sharing resources, building mutual capacities, and promoting access to open science platforms and digital infrastructures. They typically take place within the context of Georgia’s participation in international research programs, regional networks, and partnerships with both European and global organizations. Here are some key avenues through which Georgia participates in these types of collaborations: 1.	North-South and North-South-South Collaborations: Horizon Europe and Horizon 2020. Georgia has been an active participant in the Horizon Europe and Horizon 2020 programs, which are primarily EU-led initiatives that promote collaboration between European countries and other countries in the South (such as those in Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, the Middle East, and Africa). These programs fund joint research efforts and encourage the optimization of infrastructure for scientific collaboration. •	North-South collaboration: Through its participation in Horizon Europe, Georgia collaborates with European Union countries (North) on joint research projects and the sharing of open science platforms and resources. These collaborations often involve large-scale data-sharing, open access to research results, and the development of collaborative tools to enhance research productivity. •	North-South-South collaboration: Through various Horizon projects, Georgia can act as a bridge between the EU and countries in the South (e.g., in Central Asia, the Caucasus, and even Africa), fostering the exchange of knowledge and scientific infrastructure, as well as ensuring equitable access to data and tools for researchers from both sides. Example of initiatives: • Erasmus+ Program: While primarily an educational program, Erasmus+ also fosters research collaborations between universities in EU countries and those in Georgia. Open access, shared platforms, and joint infrastructure optimization are frequent outcomes of these collaborations. European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP). Georgia is also a part of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), which aims to promote stability, security, and prosperity in the southern neighborhood of the EU, including Georgia, Armenia, and Moldova. Through ENP, Georgia has been involved in collaborative scientific research initiatives and infrastructure-building projects that focus on open science, datasharing, and shared digital platforms across borders. • Example: EaP (Eastern Partnership): A key initiative in the ENP, the Eastern Partnership helps build scientific and technological capacity in Georgia and other countries in the region, and it aims to integrate those countries into the EU’s scientific and technological systems. Open science and research data sharing are often key components of these partnerships. 2.	South-South Collaborations: Collaboration with Central Asia and the Caucasus. Georgia actively engages in South-South collaboration with neighboring countries in the Caucasus and Central Asia. This includes partnerships with Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan, which are also focused on sharing research infrastructures, promoting open data, and creating interoperable research platforms. Central Asia Cooperation (CAREC) Georgia is increasingly looking to strengthen ties with Central Asian nations under Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC). These efforts include building research collaborations, sharing data, and strengthening infrastructure, which can be crucial in creating open science platforms. •	Example of joint strategies: Open Research Platform for Central Asia and the Caucasus (ORCA), a collaborative platform designed to bring together researchers from across the region, could be one potential avenue for open science collaboration, involving Georgia and its neighbors. Georgian Research and Educational Networking Association (GRENA). GRENA, the National Research and Education Network of Georgia, plays a role in fostering collaborations with regional institutions, especially in the South, to optimize access to shared infrastructures like high-speed internet, data repositories, and open-source research tools. GRENA connects Georgian institutions to regional networks, such as the Caucasus Research and Education Network (Caucasus REN), and collaborates with GEANT, a pan-European research and education network that connects many countries in Europe and beyond. 3.	Notable Partnerships and Projects Involving Georgia: 1.	GEANT and the Eastern Partnership (EaP) Through GRENA’s participation in GEANT, the European high-performance research and education network, Georgia benefits from North-South-South collaborations. The partnership helps enhance the use of shared infrastructures and digital platforms for research, including open science initiatives. • Link to GEANT: https://www.geant.org 2.	Eastern Partnership Program (EaP) and EU-funded projects The EaP includes research initiatives that provide funding and facilitate cross-border collaborations between EU countries and Eastern Partnership countries (such as Georgia, Armenia, and Moldova). This often leads to joint strategies for the use of shared platforms and resources for open science. • Link to EaP: https://www.eap-cso.eu The National Science Library of Georgia at the forefront of Open Science - https://eufordigital.eu/the-national-science-library-of-georgia-at-the-forefront-of-open-science/ 3.	Regional Projects with Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Central Asia Georgia has also participated in regional initiatives designed to optimize infrastructure use and encourage shared platforms in areas like healthcare, environmental science, and education. These efforts often include South-South collaboration between Georgia and other countries in the Caucasus and Central Asia. • Example project: The Caucasus Network of Education and Research facilitates cooperation and exchange of knowledge in the region, which may include open access tools and joint research strategies.

This has included initiatives for building infrastructure and supporting capacity in research institutions. 2. Research Institutions and Universities • Many universities and research institutions in Georgia have started integrating open science principles into their research activities, including open access to publications, data sharing, and open peer review processes. • Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State University (TSU) and other leading universities have been involved in regional and international research collaborations that promote open science. For example, TSU's engagement in EU-backed projects has facilitated capacity building activities around open data and the implementation of open access repositories. • Shota Rustaveli National Science Foundation of Georgia (SRNSFG): This agency has played a role in supporting open science through research grants and facilitating collaboration with international bodies. They have also been involved in training researchers on the principles and practices of open science. 3. Training and Workshops  • Various workshops, seminars, and capacity-building events on open science have been organized by local and international organizations. These events often target university researchers, policymakers, and library staff, aiming to raise awareness and improve skills in areas like open access publishing, data management, and research transparency. Local experts, in collaboration with European counterparts, have been conducting training sessions on topics like open data, open access journals, and the use of open research platforms. 4.	Infrastructural Development • The establishment of open access repositories has been a key component of capacity building in Georgia. For example, GEO Network is an open-access repository that allows Georgian researchers to deposit and share their publications. This platform aligns with global initiatives for making research more publicly accessible. • Several Georgian research institutions also use platforms like OpenAIRE and Zenodo to archive and share research outputs, particularly for projects that are linked to European Union funding. 5.	International Collaboration • Georgia has been actively involved in European and regional programs like Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe, which place strong emphasis on open science principles. Participation in these programs has allowed Georgian researchers to gain exposure to international best practices and implement them in their own research environments. • EINSTEIN (East European Network for Science and Technology Innovation) is another example of a regional platform where Georgian institutions collaborate with other Eastern European countries to enhance the adoption of open science.

### B4.2 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so.

NO. there isn't a specific record of dedicated capacity-building programs in Georgia focused on integrating the core values and principles of Open Science into Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI) policies and strategies. However, there have been ongoing global discussions and some initiatives within Eastern Europe that may have included Georgia or influenced local efforts. Open Science is an evolving concept that emphasizes transparency, accessibility, and the sharing of research outputs, data, and methodologies. It aims to democratize knowledge and foster innovation. As countries like Georgia increasingly engage with international organizations like the European Union, the United Nations, and UNESCO, there has been rising awareness of Open Science principles.

### B4.3 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

YES. While there isn't definitive information on the formal integration of Open Science competencies into Georgian higher education curricula, there are several trends and initiatives that suggest it could become a reality by 2025: 1. European Union and Eastern Partnership (EaP) Programs: Georgia, as part of the EU's Eastern Partnership (EaP), has been increasingly involved in research and innovation programs that often incorporate Open Science principles. The EU's "Horizon 2020" and the subsequent "Horizon Europe" programs emphasize Open Science and may influence the curriculum development in Georgian universities. 2. Open Science Training Initiatives: Several initiatives promote Open Science skills for researchers, and universities in Georgia could benefit from these, especially through partnerships with EU institutions. For example, the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) aims to foster the adoption of Open Science practices across Europe, and there may be opportunities for Georgian institutions to integrate these competencies into their curricula. 3. UNESCO and Open Science Policy: UNESCO has been active in promoting Open Science globally and has created a framework for Open Science policies that includes education and training. In 2021, UNESCO adopted a Recommendation on Open Science, calling on member states (which includes Georgia) to create national policies and integrate Open Science into research practices and curricula. 4. National Research and Innovation Strategies: Georgia’s national strategies for science, technology, and innovation (STI) could increasingly emphasize Open Science. If the government formalizes this in STI policies by 2025, higher education institutions would likely be encouraged or required to integrate Open Science competencies into their curricula. 5. Local and International Collaborations: Local universities in Georgia, such as Tbilisi State University and Ilia State University, may integrate Open Science competencies into their existing curricula through partnerships with international universities, research organizations, and research funding agencies that emphasize Open Science. This might be done through specific training programs, workshops, or even formal modules in graduate research courses. What Could Be Expected by 2025: By 2025, it’s plausible that Georgia will have begun to incorporate Open Science competencies into higher education, especially as the country aligns itself with European and global standards for research and innovation. While a formal national framework might still be under development, initiatives through universities, the EU, and other international bodies could lead to the gradual inclusion of Open Science in university curricula. The progress may depend on ongoing national policy shifts, EU-funded programs, and the wider adoption of Open Science within the regional context.

### B4.5 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

YES. there have been some initiatives in Georgia related to science communication, though efforts directly aligned with Open Science principles—which emphasize openness, transparency, and public engagement with scientific knowledge—are still developing. However, Georgia’s growing involvement in international networks and the European Union’s Horizon Europe program, which promotes Open Science, suggests that the country may be increasingly focusing on open dissemination of scientific knowledge. Resources: • Georgian National Science Foundation (GSF) In line with the values and principles of "Open Science", the Shota Rustaveli National Science Foundation of Georgia (SRNSFG) ensuring that research papers funded through state grants are freely accessible. Through its web portal, the foundation offers a rich repository of scientific knowledge via publications - both books and scientific articles, spanning a wide array of disciplines, including engineering, technology, natural sciences, medicine, agriculture, social sciences, and the humanities. This approach promotes collaboration and accessibility, benefiting both researchers and the broader public. The information is available at the following link (in Georgian): https://rustaveli.org.ge/geo/rustavelis-fondis-biblioteka • Tbilisi State University: TSU website (for news and events related to science communication and public outreach). • Caucasus Research Resource Centers (CRRC): CRRC website (for projects related to evidence-based research communication). • EU-funded Projects: Horizon Europe (for information on ongoing science communication and Open Science projects involving Georgian partners).
