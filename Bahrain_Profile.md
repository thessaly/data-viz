### B1.3: Awareness-raising activities organised
The Nasser Centre for Science and Technology(NCST) organizes and foresees several activities that contribute to the promotion of open science. One of the key initiatives is providing education and science for all, with a focus on offering advanced technical and vocational education in line with the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The center organises annual summer workshops targeting all segments of society to raise awareness about the importance of technical and industrial education. These workshops cover a wide range of topics, such as mechanical and electrical maintenance, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence tools, and soft skills development. 
Over the past years, the center has organised numerous lectures, workshops, and field visits, benefiting over 2,000 participants. The center also facilitates field visits for students from local and international institutions, providing them with hands-on experiences and fostering collaboration in the field of open science. Furthermore, the Nasser Centre conducts annual virtual orientation meetings for citizens, students, and parents, guiding them on how to access and benefit from its services.
Additionally, the center runs a Student Clubs Programme that focuses on developing students' skills and talents in cultural, social, and sports activities while enhancing their leadership and communication skills. It also organizes scientific and professional exhibitions that allow students to interact with innovations and technologies, reinforcing the concept of open science. To encourage practical application of knowledge, the center involves students in external scientific competitions that foster critical thinking, problem-solving, and innovation.
The Nasser Centre also organizes educational field visits for students to gain practical experience and interact with experts in various fields. To support open education, the center has created a student portal that offers easy access to educational resources, promoting self-directed learning and contributing to the development of a sustainable scientific community.
The Higher Education Council (HEC) has also been active in promoting open science, such as inviting higher education institutions to participate in the eighth specialized session on "Open Science: A Gateway to Accelerating Progress on the 2030 Agenda in the Post-Covid-19 Era" in March 2021. Additionally, UNESCO’s questionnaire on "Global Call for Best Practices in Open Science" was completed in May 2022. 
The Information & eGovernment Authority (iGA) has supported open government data through awareness sessions, and the UNESCO Regional Centre for Information and Communication Technology (RCICT) has raised awareness about open educational resources (OER) and open science through activities with various entities in the Ministry of Education, the Higher Education Council, and private educational institutions in the Kingdom of Bahrain.

## B2: Open Science Policies & Governance

### B2.1: National STI policy with open science elements
The Nasser Centre for Science and Technology has drawn up a national strategy on science, technology, and innovation (STI)  under the theme "National Strategy for Science, Technology, and Innovation." The blueprint was adopted in 2020 under the authority of the Ministry of Education. The strategy's key areas focus on supporting open access and public engagement in research. 
In addition, the Higher Education Council (HEC) has also developed the "National Strategy for Higher Education," which covers vision, key objectives, national aspirations for higher education in the Kingdom of Bahrain, challenges, and other related themes.  This policy, updated for the period from 2014 to 2024, outlines Bahrain’s educational and higher education framework. 
The  Bahrain Centre for Strategic, International, and Energy Studies (Derasat) notes that while there is no separate policy dedicated to open science elements, these are incorporated under Bahrain's “Economic Vision 2030.” Various government bodies have taken initiatives related to advancements in emerging technologies such as Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data Analytics, Robotics, IoT, and Smart Cities. However, not all aspects of open science have been fully addressed.
The Information & eGovernment Authority (iGA) runs the Technical Development Programme in collaboration with the Ministry of Labour. This initiative aims to enhance the skills of young Bahraini university graduates and job-seekers aged 21 to 30 in the Information Technology (IT) sector. Participants receive training, a salary, and internationally accredited professional certificates, enhancing their employment prospects in both the public and private sectors. 
Furthermore, the UNESCO Regional Centre for Information and Communication Technology (RCICT) aligns with the government's approach to supporting open access and public engagement. RCICT hosted a regional workshop in collaboration with UNESCO in 2014, leading to the creation of an Open Educational Resources (OER) policy by the Ministry of Education. 
The Centre also participated in the 2nd Arab Open Access Forum in 2021, where it held a workshop on OER and Creative Commons, benefitting approximately 260 participants from various Arab countries. Additionally, RCICT coordinated with the Arab League Educational, Cultural, and Scientific Organization (ALECSO) to host a virtual regional meeting in 2021, promoting the dissemination of open educational resources across Arab countries.

### B2.2: National policies/legal frameworks aligned with Recommendation
In the Kingdom of Bahrain, there are some policies and frameworks that address Open Science, although they are not fully aligned with the 2021 Recommendation on Open Science in all aspects. The Higher Education Council's policy, which is partly relevant, is based on the Constitution of the Kingdom of Bahrain, adopted on February 14, 2002. The Constitution addresses basic components of society in Articles 7 and 23, which provide a foundation for policies related to science, technology, and education. However, open science elements are not explicitly covered under this document. 

After the recent independence of the Higher Education Council from the Ministry of Education, both administratively and financially, the Council is working on developing a modern legislative framework to govern higher education and scientific research, which will likely incorporate aspects of open science.

The Bahrain Centre for Strategic, International and Energy Studies (Derasat) reports that there is no national policy dedicated specifically to open science. However, related provisions can be found in the “Open Government Data Policy,” the “Bahrain Open Data Portal,” and data protection measures. While these policies address some aspects of open data, there has not been a centralised approach to open science at the national level, though plans to address this may emerge under Bahrain’s Economic Vision 2030.

The UNESCO Regional Centre for Information and Communication Technology (RCICT) reports that a committee for Open Educational Resources (OER) has been established within the Ministry of Education. Additionally, the concepts of OER and Open Science are integrated into the Ministry’s strategies and planning, further contributing to the development of an Open Science framework in the country. However, more comprehensive national policies on Open Science are still under development.

### B2.3: Specific policy instruments promoting open science
There are limited specific policy instruments aimed at promoting Open Science. The Higher Education Council is in the process of developing regulations and guidelines for the operation of higher education institutions. While there is no current regulation explicitly focused on open science, the Council intends to consider such a regulation as it moves forward with its development of institutional frameworks. 

The Bahrain Centre for Strategic, International, and Energy Studies (Derasat) notes that there is no dedicated policy for open science. This is due to a lack of awareness about open science principles, a nascent research ecosystem, and a greater focus on economic growth and digital transformation, which currently take precedence over academic and research frameworks related to open science. 

However, the UNESCO Regional Centre for Information and Communication Technology (RCICT) highlights an important development. The Ministry of Education in Bahrain published an Open Educational Resources (OER) policy in 2015, which is reviewed and updated annually. 

This policy promotes the licensing of educational, training, and research content produced under the Ministry’s umbrella with open licences, specifically Creative Commons licences. It encourages the free distribution, use, modification, and sharing of educational content, thereby supporting open access to knowledge and contributing to the broader dissemination of education and training. This policy represents an important step in promoting Open Science, although it is focused specifically on educational materials.

### B2.4: National implementation plan / roadmap
There is currently no national implementation plan, strategy, policy, or roadmap specifically for the national implementation of Open Science in alignment with the 2021 Recommendation. The Higher Education Council is in the process of developing a national strategy for Higher Education and Scientific Research for the period 2025-2035, which is expected to incorporate the implementation of open science. However, some higher education institutions have already adopted practices related to open science.

The Bahrain Centre for Strategic, International, and Energy Studies (Derasat) points out that there is a lack of awareness about open science principles, a nascent research ecosystem, and a greater emphasis on economic growth and digital transformation over academic and research frameworks. Consequently, open science remains a secondary concern.

The UNESCO Regional Centre for Information and Communication Technology (RCICT) also reports that there is no formal national plan for implementing Open Science at the country level. However, RCICT supports the Ministry of Education in advancing Bahrain’s educational system and improving student learning outcomes, teacher performance, and community awareness of educational resource policies. These efforts indirectly contribute to the goals of Open Science by promoting digital empowerment and open access to educational resources.

### B2.5: Institutional open science policies
Several institutions and organizations have initiatives that promote Open Science in line with the 2021 Recommendation at the institutional level. For example, Derasat, the Bahrain Centre for Strategic, International, and Energy Studies, has established collaborative partnerships with academic and research units worldwide, which enhances the co-production of knowledge and fosters the exchange of ideas and expertise. The think tank’s E-Library also contributes to public accessibility to its research. 

The University of Bahrain supports open science by promoting open access through its dedicated journals and a robust scientific research department, while also funding research and academic dialogue as part of its key activities.

Additionally, the UNESCO Regional Centre for Information and Communication Technology (RCICT) plans to deliver workshops to raise awareness about the definition, values, and applications of Open Science, and is currently collaborating with Category II UNESCO centers to further these goals.

### B2.6: National funding mechanisms for open science
In the Kingdom of Bahrain, there are several scholarship opportunities for students, both nationally and internationally, that indirectly support Open Science by fostering academic excellence. These scholarships are provided by various entities, such as the Ministry of Education, the Al-Mabbarah Alkhalifia Foundation, and the Crown Prince International Scholarship Programme (CPISP), among others, and are targeted towards undergraduate and postgraduate studies. 

Additionally, public schools in Kingdom of Bahrain are fully funded through the budget allocated by the Ministry of Finance and National Economy, post-approval. However, at the national level, there are no specific funding mechanisms dedicated solely to open science. 

While private higher education institutions receive funding for scientific research through a requirement to allocate at least 3% of their annual net revenue, as per Decision No. 206 of 2023 by the Higher Education Council (HEC), these funds are not specifically designated for Open Science. 

Similarly, institutions like Bahrain Centre for Strategic, International and Energy Studies (Derasat) and the UNESCO Regional Centre for Information and Communication Technology (RCICT) do not have specific funding for Open Science initiatives.

### B2.7: Open science integrated into research funding
Open Science practices have not been integrated into existing research funding mechanisms. The Higher Education Council does not include specific open science practices in its funding framework. However, some higher education institutions, such as Kingdom University, have adopted activities related to open science, like supporting the publication of peer-reviewed journals and ensuring their public accessibility. 

Despite these efforts, there is no formal integration of open science practices into the national research funding structure. Institutions such as Bahrain Centre for Strategic, International and Energy Studies (Derasat) and the UNESCO Regional Centre for Information and Communication Technology (RCICT) also do not have Open Science practices embedded in their funding mechanisms, largely due to limited awareness and understanding of Open Science.

### B2.8: Public-private partnerships for open science
Efforts to foster equitable public-private partnerships on Open Science in the Kingdom of  Bahrain are underway and planned for the near future. The Higher Education Council has outlined an initiative in its Operational Plan for 2023-2026 to create a National Research Network, aiming to promote collaboration among researchers, academic institutions, and industry stakeholders to drive innovation and enhance the impact of scientific research. 

Public-private partnerships are also a key strategy within Bahrain's Economic Vision 2030, and while there is no explicit open science mandate, policies are in place to encourage these partnerships for both economic and academic purposes. 

Additionally, the National Research Strategy 2014-2024 further supports these collaborations. The UNESCO Regional Centre for Information and Communication Technology (RCICT) is also actively engaging in communication with UNESCO’s CI office on the implementation of Open Educational Resources (OER) and Open Science in the fields of ICT and education. 

The UNESCO Regional Centre for Information and Communication Technology (RCICT) is collaborating with entities that share similar developmental visions and goals to build research networks in educational technology and creativity, benefiting from the experiences of universities and research institutions through the Ministry of Education and Higher Education Council. These initiatives reflect a growing commitment to fostering equitable public-private partnerships in Open Science by the end of 2025.

### B2.9: National monitoring framework for open science
Currently, there is no national monitoring framework for Open Science in the Kingdom of Bahrain, nor are there specific indicators related to Open Science included in the national monitoring and evaluation framework for Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI) policy. 
The Higher Education Council has indicated that this may be considered in the future, but at present, no formal monitoring system exists. Similarly, institutions such as Bahrain Centre for Strategic, International and Energy Studies (Derasat)  and the UNESCO Regional Centre for Information and Communication Technology (RCICT) do not have specific frameworks or indicators for Open Science.

## B3: Infrastructure

### B3.1: R&D expenditure as % of GDP
The latest official data on Bahrain's research and development (R&D) expenditure as a percentage of its national Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is 0.1%, based on 2014 statistics. This data is sourced from the World Bank and the UIS (UNESCO Institute for Statistics) and reflects the R&D expenditure relative to the country's GDP for that year.

### B3.2: Population with access to reliable internet
The latest official data on internet access in the Kingdom of Bahrain indicates that 99% of the population had access to the internet as of the beginning of 2024, according to the "Digital 2024: Bahrain" report by DataReportal. 
Additionally, other sources show that as of 2023, the figure for internet access stood at 100%, according to the World Bank. The Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA) also reports that, as of 2022, 100% of the population had access to reliable internet and bandwidth. These statistics reflect Bahrain’s high level of connectivity in recent years.

### B3.3: National Research and Education Network (NREN)
Currently, there are no national research and education networks (NRENs) fully operational in the Kingdom of Bahrain, though efforts are underway to establish one. The Higher Education Council has outlined the creation of a national research network as part of its operational plan for 2023-2026. 
On the other hand, Bahrain Centre for Strategic, International and Energy Studies (Derasat)  confirms that there are existing networks primarily accessible to educational campuses across the country. These networks are part of the design and implementation of a novel networking architecture for academic institutions in Bahrain, under the NREN section. While progress is being made, the full establishment of a national research network is still in development.
