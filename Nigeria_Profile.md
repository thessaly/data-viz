### B2.6 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so

Up until now, there are very few funding bodies. There is very little knowledge about open science. A lot of what has been done in open science have been more by accident than deliberate. Maybe with the advocacy from the UNESCO and with the present synergy with the Federal Ministry of Innovation, Science and Technology seen to be championing the efforts to get the National Research and Innovation Bill passed into law by the National Assembly, improved awareness could lead to funding from TETFUND if well-handled and other funding support by donor partners to take care of open science and it’s allied matters.

### B2.7 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so

Open Science practices are still being viewed as new; however, the requisite awareness is being built through the strategies in the National Science, Technology, and Innovation Policy and some other sectoral practices.

### B2.8 — Please provide details and links as relevant

FMIST Support for Industry-Academia Partnerships: The National Office for Technology Acquisition and Promotion (NOTAP) an agency under the auspices of the Federal Ministry of Innovation, Science and Technology (FMIST) has implemented programs to link researchers with industries, ensuring that scientific outputs are accessible while maintaining intellectual property rights. The initiative by NOTAP includes the NOTAP-Industry Technology Transfer Fellowship (NITTF), the NOTAP-Industry Research Laboratory Upgrade (NIRLUP), and the Technology Story Board (TSB) Initiatives to support open access to research innovations and patent-backed technologies, fostering public-private engagements.  A.	The Technology Story Board (TSB) Programme: The Technology Story Board (TSB) was initiated and launched by the Office as a partnership with industry to evolve a viable tool to popularize STI at the basic education level using simplified manufacturing flow processes as pictorial and story book education materials. It aims at arousing and sustaining the interest of school children in STI from the basic level to emerge as a critical mass of future national technical workforce. B.	The NOTAP-Industry Technology Transfer Fellowship (NITTF): This is a partnership project initiated by NOTAP and funded by industry (as part of their corporate social responsibility/investment) to provide PhD scholarships to qualified Nigerians to study in Nigerian Universities. The partnership ensures that industry specific needs are addressed through the sponsored researches, thus facilitating research to industry linkage, promoting demand driven research, building domestic research capacity/capabilities and proffering domestic solutions to industry needs. At completion, the research results are owned by industry, which can proceed to commercialize it, while the researcher becomes a hub to breed more industry-oriented researchers for the academic system. C.	NOTAP-Industry Research Laboratory Upgrade (NIR-LUP): This is another partnership project initiated by NOTAP to encourage industry to facilitate through the upgrade and equipping of research laboratories in selected Nigerian knowledge institutions. This supports the provision of the necessary  Nigeria Open Data Initiative (NODI): The government-led Nigeria Open Data Initiative (NODI), supported by private sector partners like Google, Microsoft, and local tech startups, promotes open access to government and scientific data. This initiative aligns with Nigeria’s open government commitments, allowing private-sector participation in open science-driven innovations. Open Innovation Programs of FMICDE: The National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) an Agency under the Federal Ministry of Innovation, Communication and Digital Economy (FMICDE) has launched open innovation challenges that encourage public-private research collaborations in areas such as AI, health informatics, and smart agriculture. Startups and research institutions collaborate on projects where findings are shared openly while ensuring fair licensing models. Public-Private Collaboration in Research & Innovation: TETFund and private technology firms (e.g., MainOne, MTN Foundation, and NITDA-supported tech hubs) are collaborating to fund research in ICT, agriculture, and renewable energy, ensuring open access to data and findings. The Nigerian Research and Education Network (NgREN), supported by private telecommunications and ICT companies, is improving broadband infrastructure for open science platforms.

### B2.9 — Please provide details and links as relevant

Nigeria is in the process of developing a national monitoring framework for open science, with efforts to integrate specific indicators into the broader national monitoring and evaluation framework for STI policy. The National Office for Technology Acquisition and Promotion (NOTAP) plays a pivotal role in aligning intellectual property rights (IPR) with Nigeria’s open science agenda. As the regulatory agency responsible for technology transfer agreements, patent registration, and research commercialization, NOTAP ensures that scientific innovations are documented and protected while also fostering open access to publicly funded research outputs. A critical component of this effort is the structured management of expired IPR to enhance public availability and accessibility of knowledge. By creating mechanisms to transition expired patents and research findings into the public domain, Nigeria aims to maximize the societal and economic benefits of scientific advancements. Additionally, ongoing policy discussions are exploring ways to introduce specific open science indicators, including IPR accessibility metrics, open-access publication rates, and data-sharing frameworks, into the national STI monitoring system. This structured approach ensures a balanced framework where intellectual property protection coexists with open science principles, ultimately fostering innovation, knowledge diffusion, and inclusive scientific collaboration.

## B4 – Education, Capacity Building & Science Communication

### B4.1 — Please indicate if those capacity building initiatives are formal or informal and provide more information and links as relevant

Most of them are informal. The National Library organized 2 cohorts of digital literacy training to train information professionals on research data management and repository implementation. There was training and ranking of open educational resources in Nigeria by NUC in 2018.

### B4.2 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so.

There have been no structured, nationwide capacity-building programs specifically designed for policymakers to integrate open science principles into Nigeria’s Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI) policies and strategies. Although bits of awareness has been done generally for fractions of researchers and academia, these efforts have not been formally extended to policymakers at a national level. Some the key challenges include: •	Fragmented Awareness Efforts: While organizations like WACREN and LIBSENSE promote open science in academia, there is no coordinated capacity-building initiative targeting government officials responsible for policy formulation. •	Resource Constraints: The absence of dedicated funding and institutional mechanisms has hindered the implementation of formal training programs for policymakers on open science. •	Need for Strategic Policy Reform: Current policy frameworks do not explicitly mandate capacity-building programs for policymakers in open science, resulting in a gap in awareness and implementation at the decision-making level. •	Open science is not yet a central component of Nigeria’s STI policy framework, and structured training programs for policymakers remain undeveloped specifically to Open Science in focus, as such there are plans to bridge this gap by developing structured training programs and integrating open science core values and principles into the policy.

### B4.3 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

Yes, Nigerian Universities are mandated to have university research policy, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Policy, and they are also to adhere to the National Policy on Open Educational Resources in Higher Education in Nigeria and other policy documents that guide their research, thereby promoting open science.

### B4.5 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

Generally, Nigeria has recently taken steps to promote science communication aligned with open science principles, most notably through the "Revised National Policy on Science, Technology and Innovation 2022" which explicitly encourages the adoption of open science practices among researchers and stakeholders, marking a significant move towards wider dissemination of scientific knowledge to diverse audiences including researchers, policymakers, and the public at large; this policy is considered the first major framework to support open science implementation in the country. But, there are plans to scale up this activities since the impact so far is still not significant enough in terms of awareness.

## B5 – Research Assessment and Incentives

### B5.1 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

i.	Initiatives for Open Science:The LIBSENSE Open Science Symposiumis a WACREN-led program aimed at building a community of practice for open science and progressing the adoption of open science services and infrastructures in Africa, While specific dates for 2025 are not yet mentioned, the LIBSENSE symposium is organized by WACREN, in collaboration with key stakeholders such as the Conference of Vice Chancellors of Nigerian Universities (CVCNU), the Association of University Librarians in Nigerian Universities (AULNU), and Eko-Konnect, and supported by organizations like the UK Foreign Commonwealth Development Office (FCDO). The symposium focuses on enhancing the infrastructure and avenues for publishing and disseminating Nigerian research, with an emphasis on elevating its visibility and impact globally. It aligns with the broader goals of participating organizations like the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) and the Directory of Open Access Books (DOAB) and was a success in 2024.   The initiative has made significant strides in advancing open science across Africa, as highlighted in its Impact Report Link: https://libsense.ren.africa/en/nigeria-open-science-symposium/ 	    https://baobab.wacren.net/records/kym89-1p308 ii.	There has been awareness and sensitization by the Early Career Researchers of Libsense and WACREN to convince university authorities to review existing research assessment and evaluation processes in order to align them with open science principles and values. LIBSENSE (Library Support for Embedded NREN Services and E-infrastructure) is a WACREN-led programme aimed at building a community of practice for open science and progressing the adoption of open science services and infrastructures in Africa. However, this awareness is significant enough in terms of reach because Nigeria has over 200 (Two Hundred) universities and research institutes. It involves key stakeholders like CVCNU, AULNU, and Eko-Konnect Link: https://www.eko-konnect.org.ng/libsense/ iii.	 Potentially, there is an expected initiative to improve awareness creation and sensitization of the researchers, academia, and the public on the need to review the existing research assessment and evaluation processes in order to align them with open science principles and values driven by the UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science, which encourages a shift towards more open and inclusive research practices across all levels with collaboration with universities and research-performing institutions by the end of 2025.

### B5.2 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so.

Although Open Science principles and practices have been integrated and recognized in the National Policy on Science, Technology and Innovation, this is expected to cut across all sectors including knowledge institution. However, it is yet to be incorporated into the Career evaluation and progression systems

### B5.3 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so.

As of 2024, Nigeria has not implemented a structured national initiative to formally recognize and reward open science practices. Several challenges and obstacles contribute to this gap, including: Limited Institutional Incentives: Many universities and research institutions in Nigeria still prioritize traditional research output metrics (such as journal impact factors and citation counts) over open science contributions (such as open-access publications, data sharing, and reproducibility efforts). Also, tenure and promotion criteria in most Nigerian universities and research institutions do not yet formally recognize open science contributions as a key assessment metric Funding Constraints and Competing Priorities:Funding for research and development is grossly  limited, and most available funding is directed toward core scientific research rather than establishing incentive mechanisms for open science adoption. Also, existing research grants and funding bodies (such as TETFund and NUC) have not yet incorporated specific rewards for open science compliance. Absence of Institutional Collaboration for Reward Mechanisms: Unlike in some developed countries where research councils and funding bodies provide awards and grants for open science, Nigeria lacks a multi-stakeholder framework that brings together government agencies, academic institutions, and private sector players to drive such initiatives. Lack of Awareness and Cultural Shift Challenges: Many researchers in Nigeria are still unfamiliar with the benefits of open science and the role that recognition and incentives can play in encouraging its adoption.There is resistance among some scholars who fear that open science practices may undermine their competitive advantage or intellectual property rights.

## B7 – International Cooperation

### B7.1 — How is your country promoting and facilitating international scientific collaborations on open science as outlined in the 2021 Recommendation on Open Science?

FMIST collaborates with UNESCO and the National Commission for UNESCO, and other international partners on Open Science initiatives aimed at sharing infrastructure, training, and best practices.          Link : https://www.unesco.org/en/open-science/implementation          Other forms of collaboration include : 	Nigeria is actively participating in international discussions on open science, encouraging researchers to share data and publications through open access platforms, building capacity through training programs, and fostering collaborations with international research institutions, all in line with the 2021 UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science, aiming to make research outputs accessible and inclusive for global scientific advancement. 	Generally, Nigeria is prioritizing developing a national strategy/framework that encourages open access to research data, publications, and tools, promoting capacity-building initiatives for researchers, investing in the necessary infrastructure for data sharing, and fostering a culture of collaboration across institutions, all while considering potential legal and ethical challenges related to data privacy and intellectual property rights, primarily leveraging the recently revised national Science, Technology, and Innovation Policy (NSTIP 2022) as the key framework for implementation.

### B7.2 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

Nigeria has established multiple strategies and initiatives to promote cross-border collaboration in open science through policy frameworks, capacity-building efforts, and regional partnerships: 1.	African Open Science Platform (AOSP): Nigeria is engaging in AOSP, which promotes open data-sharing and best practices across African countries but there is low awareness of this platform in Nigeria. Link: https://aosp.org.za/ 2.	ECOWAS Science, Technology, and Innovation Policy (ECOPOST):Nigeria, as a key ECOWAS member, participates in the regional STI framework that encourages open science collaboration among West African nations but again the awareness level is low amongst stakeholders in Nigeria. Link: https://ecowas.int/ecowas-commission-organizes-african-forum-for-research-and-innovation-fari-2022-in-abuja/ 3.	UNESCO Cooperation on Open Science: Nigeria has aligned its National Open Science Framework with UNESCO's Recommendation on Open Science (2021) to improve multi-stakeholder participation in open research.This seems to be the latest progress made and holds potential to improve general awareness on the principles and practice of Open Science in Nigeria. Link:https://www.unesco.org/en/open-science 4.	Capacity-Building Programs in Open Science:TETFund and NITDA support knowledge exchange programs with regional and international partners to build expertise in digital research and open-access publishing. This is a recent development but the process is slow due to low funding. Link: https://nitda.gov.ng/

### B7.3 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

## B8 – Other

### B8.1 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

I. Insufficient Funding for Open Science Initiatives: Many universities and research institutions lack dedicated funding to develop open-access repositories and maintain compliance with open science policies. The government through funding agencies, such as TETFund and NITDA, are making progress, but sustained investment is needed to fully implement UNESCO's recommendations; ii.	Intellectual Property (IP) and Copyright Concerns: Researchers and institutions sometimes hesitate to fully embrace open science due to concerns about intellectual property rights, data security, and potential misuse of research outputs. NOTAP (National Office for Technology Acquisition and Promotion) is working on policy frameworks to balance open science with IP protection, but challenges persist, hence the need for technical support in terms of Nationwide capacity-building programmes/ sensitization workshops for researchers; iii.	  Limited International Collaboration and Technology Transfer: Nigeria's participation in global open science networks is still developing, with limited South-South and North-South collaborations. Aside from UNESCO, the lack of agreements with major international research bodies restricts access to global funding and knowledge exchange.

### B9 — Any other comments

Nigeria is committed to advancing open science through ongoing policy direction/implementation, institutional initiatives, and stakeholder engagement. However, there is a need for greater capacity-building for policymakers, sustainable funding for open science infrastructure, and stronger regional and international collaborations. Support from UNESCO and other partners will be crucial in accelerating progress
