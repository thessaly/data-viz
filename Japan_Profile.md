## B8 – Other

### B8.1 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

The distribution of schorlaly publications and scientific data is now under the market dominance of global academic publishers, and the subscription fees for academic journals and article processing charges (APC)  are increasing considerably. These soring prices could have adverse effects such as increasing the financial burden on universities, researchers, and others involved in the core activities of academic research, such as subscribing to academic journals and publishing academic papers, and undermining the autonomy of the research community. Moreover, it is necessary to aim establishment and transition to new systems for evaluation and assessment providing incentives for open access while understanding and analyzing the current situation and problems in order to break away the excessive dependence on quantitative indicators in research evaluation and assessment.
