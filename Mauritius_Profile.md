### B2.6 — Please provide details and links as relevant

Mauritius has implemented specific funding mechanisms to support open science through the Open Educational Resources (OER) Policy. This policy provides support for publicly funded institutions to align their resources and initiatives with UN Sustainable Development Goal 4 and related SDGs. Additionally, private higher education institutions are encouraged to leverage this framework by adopting the national OER Policy, thus further enabling the creation and dissemination of OER materials. Publicly funded educational institutions and autonomous bodies are guided by this policy to channel resources effectively toward open educational initiatives.   The Higher Education Commission provides funding for researchers at higher education institutions (HEIs) to undertake research projects. Additionally, public research HEIs also offer financial support to their faculty members who are involved in research.

### B2.7 — Please provide details and links as relevant

Some publications emanated from HEC’s funded projects are published in Open Access journals and with the development of an open science policy, this element will be captured.  MRIC publish all reports of funded projects on a Research Repository open to the public. There is also wide dissemination of funded projects to the public at large  The University of Mauritius has policies that require researchers to consider open science practices when applying for internal research funding. This includes commitments to open access publishing and data sharing. In addition, open science practices have been integrated into existing research funding mechanisms through several channels:  • Higher Education Commission (HEC) website provides transparent access to research funding opportunities and guidelines  • University of Mauritius (UoM) website features research funding mechanisms and open science requirements  • Regular workshops organized to inform researchers about funding opportunities and open science requirements  • Research Week (RW) organization with internal funding support to promote research dissemination  • Internal funding mechanisms that incorporate open science principles • Dedicated resources for research dissemination and knowledge sharing.  These mechanisms demonstrate our commitment to integrating open science practices into the research funding landscape, ensuring transparency and accessibility of research outputs. Sharing of Open Scientific Knowledge is done e.g. Research Symposiums, Conferences (both local and international) and the UoM Research Week is held yearly. UoM works in close collaboration with industry, NGOs, Ministries, International Organisations by way of Research Collaborative Agreements and Memoranda of Understanding

From a simple check on Wikipedia, we can count over 140 NRENs worldwide 2024. Sadly, a Mauritian NREN is not (yet) on the list. Discussions however to initiate such a network started around October 2015 with a small team of academics. Presentations and documents were shared with the Ministry of Education since then, culminating in the visit of the CEO of the UbuntuNet Alliance in December 2019. During his visit, along with a strong delegation, a number of initiatives were taken including a full-day workshop on the importance of NRENs (where the Minister of Education was present) and a high-level round-table committee meeting hosted at the Ministry of Education with the attendance of representatives of the Ministry of TCI and Ministry of Finance. The meeting ended on a very positive note with all stakeholders agreeing to the importance of an NREN for the country.  The UbuntuNet Alliance has obtained funding of the order of 16 million USD to enable the set-up of new NRENs in Africa. Mauritius forms part of a list of contenders for this funding which will cover about 80% of capital costs (totaling about 2 million USD) for the NREN connection to the UbuntuNet Alliance network. The other 20% (or some 400,000 USD) should be provisioned by the country and could be sourced from Government funding or other means.  The main obstacles for the setting of the Mauritian NREN are: 1.	Financial – the 20% from Government funding as well as the financial model for the NREN for its sustainability 2.	The Technical aspects in terms of the type of technology to be sued for the inland connectivity.  There are no dedicated NRENS however, there are a repository of research reports available on the MRIC website, accessible to the public. However, not all reports are fully available.  Regarding digital archiving and public access to research, the University of Mauritius (UoM) has initiated efforts in this area. The UoM Library also provides access to various digital resources and repositories. Access matrix has been inserted in section 1.3

### B3.4 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so.

MRIC Research Repository: Mauritius Research Repository Not yet  Currently, there are no established open science infrastructures. The main reasons may be attributed to the following: • It could be that there has been insufficient financial investment directed toward building and maintaining open science facilities, which limits our ability to create robust systems that support research collaboration and data sharing. • Existing regulations often hinder effective collaboration between public and private sectors, making it difficult to establish comprehensive infrastructures that facilitate open science practices. • Current research infrastructures tend to be fragmented, lacking coordination and integration necessary for effective open science practices. However, at the University of Mauritius, there are some-level of digital infrastructures in place: • Research Management Information System at the University of Mauritius for managing research data and outputs • Project-specific websites (e.g., DESIRA website) providing access to research information and results • Subscription to Elsevier, providing researchers access to: o Scientific publications o Research databases of Academic resources

## B7 – International Cooperation

### B7.1 — How is your country promoting and facilitating international scientific collaborations on open science as outlined in the 2021 Recommendation on Open Science?

At the level of HEC, we have a scheme titled ‘Recruitment of International Faculty’ to promote and enhance international scientific collaborations, using the concept of open resources.   While many academics strive to engage in international research collaborations, these efforts often occur without fully embracing the necessary practices of open science. Nevertheless, the ongoing initiatives reflect a commitment to fostering international scientific collaborations that align with open science principles. By encouraging transparency, inclusivity, and cooperation among diverse stakeholders, we are working towards a more equitable and accessible scientific landscape that benefits both science and society as a whole. MIE-   International research collaborations.  See section 3.6

### B7.2 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

There is recognition of the importance of fostering collaboration in open science, and discussions are ongoing about the potential for developing a comprehensive strategy in the future. Efforts to raise awareness and build capacity in open science practices must be considered as steps towards enhancing international cooperation.

### B7.3 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so.

We are not aware of any discussions regarding the establishment of regional and international funding mechanisms for open science. This lack of awareness may be due to limited communication about ongoing initiatives or the absence of active participation in such discussions. However, we recognize the importance of funding mechanisms for promoting open science and hope to explore opportunities for involvement in future discussions. OUM: The IORAG newsletter on its activities regarding fisheries management, maritime safety and security, trade and investment facilities, disaster risk management, academic sciences and technology cooperation are available to the public on its website.
