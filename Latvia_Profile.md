## B1 – Promotion of the UNESCO 2021 Recommendation on Open Science

### B1.1 — If yes, please indicate which ministries and or national authorities/entities have been involved in the promotion of the 2021 Recommendation

Ministry of Culture, Ministry of Economics, Latvian Council of Science, Latvian National Library

### B1.3 — If yes, please provide details on the activities organized or foreseen and links as relevant

Open science is a key theme for many science communication activities organized through the "Research In Latvia" platform (https://researchlatvia.gov.lv/en), including the 5th World Congress of Latvian Scientists. Furthermore, the universities (University of Latvia, Riga Technical University and Riga Stradiņš University) have dedicated staff working on Open Science topics who organize many events aimed at the academic community.
