## B1 – Promotion of the UNESCO 2021 Recommendation on Open Science

### B1.1 — If yes, please indicate which ministries and or national authorities/entities have been involved in the promotion of the 2021 Recommendation

With the coordination of the Ministry of Education, Science, Culture & Sport of Republic of Armenia, 4 Armenian universities (Armenian State University of Economics, Yerevan Brusov State University of Languages and Social Sciences (YSULS), Yerevan State Medical University, Yerevan State University (YSU) were involved in the "Strengthening Research Management and Open Science Capacities of HEIs in Moldova and Armenia (MINERVA)" Erasmus+ Program. Under the Program, representative of other research organizations and universities also took part in informational meetings and trainings.

### B1.3 — If yes, please provide details on the activities organized or foreseen and links as relevant

Most of the research periodicals in Armenia are free of charge which contributes to accessibility of research results within the country. In addition, to foster the international accessibility of research result of Armenian researcher, a new grant program was launched by the Higher Education and Science Committee to reimburse the publication fee for Armenian researchers publishing their results in Open Access journals. At the same time, for all other 20 grant programs carried out by the Higher Education and Science Committee, the research groups are entitled to allocate budget means for publications in Open Access journals (indexed by Scopus and WoS)

### B1.4 — If yes, please indicate the actions that are taken to incorporate the specific values and principles. For each case, please provide details and links as relevant

There is a mandatory provision in the terms of the research grants launched by the Higher Education and Science Committee, urging the beneficiaries of the grant programs to ensure the creation and dissemination of popular science materials about the Project or their particular field of science (interviews, publications in popular science journals, creation, and distribution of video materials, organization of discussions for general audience, etc.). These dissemination efforts shall be considered when evaluating and accepting the Project's final report.

### B2.2 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so

The Roadmap for the integration of the field of R&D of the Republic of Armenia in the ERA (Order MESCS, 29 January 2020, N59) already includes the following open science activities – promotion of open access to scientific publications and data and supporting the development of knowledge transfer and open innovation. At the same time, according the ESCS Minister’s Order N2121-A/2 dated 29 Dec 2021, an Expert Group for Open Science was established with the aim of studying the possibilities of OS full implementation in Armenia. Currently, the MESCS has elaborated the draft version of the “Goals and Guidelines on Open Science Policy of the RA” and the activities towards its adoption as a legal act will be carried out after the adoption of the new RA Law “On Higher Education and Science”.

### B2.3 — Please provide details and links as relevant, including for each instrument: Title of the instrument, its objective, the authority in charge, allocated budget, elements of open science included

### B2.6 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so

There is no separate mechanism for open science, however OS fostering activities are supported in the frameworks of the three funding mechanisms of research and technical activities in the RA: baseline funding (facilities, labs, devices, salaries, maintenance), grant program funding and targeted (interdepartmental cooperation with other ministries). As it was mentioned before, there is a separate grant program for encouraging Armenian researchers’ publications in Open Access journals. In addition, the current research periodicals in Armenia are Open Access journals.

### B2.7 — Please provide details and links as relevant

In addition to the provisions mentioned in p. 35, the Higher Education and Science Committee has launched a portal https://equipment.hesc.am/ where the details of all the research equipment of state research organizations is available.

### B2.8 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so

After the adoption of Open Science White Paper in Armenia, it will be possible to take measures to foster public-private partnership in research field.

## B3 – Open Science Infrastructure

### B3.1 — What is the latest official data for your country’s percentage of national gross domestic product (GDP) dedicated to research and development expenditure? Please also indicate the year of publication of this data, and to which year(s) it refers.

In 2024, the budget allocations for R&D comprised 0.39 % of the GDP of Armenia.

### B3.2 — What is the latest official data for the percentage of your country's population that have access to reliable internet and bandwidth? Please also indicate the year of publication of this data, and to which year(s) it refers
