### B2.4 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so

Portugal does not currently have a national strategy plan for open science. Nevertheless, FCT, as the main national funding organization for research, has integrated open science values and principles into its annual strategic plan. The Scientific Knowledge Area of FCT is responsible for implementing the targeted plans to advance open access and open data practices, such as:   Plan and Strategy for Open Access to Scientific Publications:    The FCT adopted an open access policy for scientific publications in 2014, motivated by developments in European Strategies, Directives and Regulations in open science. More recently and by adherence to Plan S and the development of diamond open access related services (e.g., PubIn, SciELO Portugal, SARC) and open infrastructures (PTCRIS, RCAAP, institutional repositories, PIDs, AAI), the policy is under review to ensure that all publications (scientific articles, books, theses and dissertations) resulting from publicly funded research are accessible without restrictions. This open access policy was reviewed and recently published. Taking leverage of the plan of National Open Science Policy (2016), FCT will continue to strengthen partnerships with international organizations and initiatives, such as cOAlition S, UNESCO, Science Europe, ICOLC (International Coalition of Library Consortia), by aligning with global standards and sharing best practices.      Plan and Strategy for Open Access to Research Data:    The National Programme for Open Science and Open Research Data (PNCADAI) aims to support the scientific community by providing tools, services, and infrastructure to facilitate the transition to digital science and technology, and by creating and establishing a national network to support research data management. The FCT plan involves the implementation of digital services to support the management of research data in each step of its life cycle; the development of storage and backup infrastructures; and digital services that support FAIR data, such as persistent identifiers, indicators of open science and monitoring and compliance services. It promotes the principles of Open Science, encouraging the reuse of research results and the dissemination of scientific knowledge. The plan ensures compliance with national and international standards, including the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), Research Data Alliance (RDA) and the FAIR data principles.   Plan and Strategy for Models of scientific communication:   The FCT has also been working on new models of science communication to address key issues in the dissemination of scientific knowledge, promoting equity, sustainability, speed, and transparency. Based on Plan S principles, transformative agreements have been negotiated through b-on (Online Knowledge Library), a FCT service, to encourage publishers to switch to an open access publishing model. Moreover, FCT aims to continue to support and align with Diamond Open Access initiatives, such as the European Diamond Capacity Hub, and to develop and promote national initiatives, such as Pub In.    Other models of scientific communication have also been promoted by FCT among the scientific community, such as subscribing to Open (S2O) and the Rights Retention Strategy.
