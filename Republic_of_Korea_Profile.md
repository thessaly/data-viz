### B2.5: Institutional open science policies
Yes. Since 2014, the National Library of Korea has supported research organizations, schools, and public institutions to establish open access repositories. As a result, a total of 61 institutional open access repositories were developed and are in operation as of 2023. The National Library of Korea also established an open access policy in line with the UNESCO Recommendation and has been supporting other organizations in developing their own open access policies. Eight Korean institutions (National Library of Korea, Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology, Ajou University Central Library, Yonsei University Medical Library, Jeonbuk State Institute, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs (KIHSA), and Korea Institute of Ocean Science & Technology) have developed their own open access policies which are being enlisted in the international Registry of Open Access Repository Mandates and Policies (ROARMAP) (https://roarmap.entities.org/1948/). Since 2018, the Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information (KISTI) has also developed and implemented its open access policy registered in the international ROARMAP. 
Meanwhile, the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) and the Korea Federation of Science & Technology Societies (KOFST) have provided financial support to domestic academic societies for journal publishing through the project (i.e., Domestic Academic Organization Support Project) funding from the Ministry of Education. The project evaluation indicators include “whether the journal is free to access (or open access)," which eventually facilitates domestic society-owned journals to adopt a Diamond OA  model. Currently, 1,257 out of 2,831 journals enlisted in the KCI Academic Database of the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) provide full access to their original content without charge. In addition, it is becoming more common for a research organization, such as the National Institute of Ecology, to publish its organizational journals as open access.
Selective public research organizations are also equipped with data sharing platforms. The National Institute of Ecology operates the EcoBank platform that gathers and distributes ecological data, and the Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources (KIGAM) runs the Geo Open Big Data Platform. Plus, KIGAM and some other public research organizations have their own research data policies to manage research data at the institutional level.

### B2.6: National funding mechanisms for open science
No. There is no dedicated single funding mechanism exclusively for open science. However, there are a variety of government funding programs in which the Korean government supports specific open science practices and R&D activities that reflect the core principles of the UNESCO Open Science Recommendation.

### B2.7: Open science integrated into research funding
Yes. The core values of the UNESCO Open Science Recommendation and specific open science practices are supported by the existing research funding mechanisms. The Korean government supports national R&D programs and public research institutions relevant to open science to facilitate the sharing and utilization of research data and public engagement in science. 
In addition, when the results of a national research and development (R&D) project are published as open access articles, the article processing charge (APC) can be reimbursed from the project budget.
As the Republic of Korea joins the Pillar 2 program of EU Horizon Europe as an associate member in 2024, Korean participants of the EU program are expected to comply with the Horizon Europe requirements on open access publishing and research data management.

### B2.8: Public-private partnerships for open science
Yes. Public-private partnerships are being fostered in the process of implementing open science. Not only government entities but also academic societies, publishers, private organizations, and societal actors have participated in the implementation of the UNESCO Open Science Recommendation. 
For alternative transformative agreements with global publishers, the Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information (KISTI) organized the Transformative Agreement Working Group, in which relevant domestic stakeholders got together and explored available options. It began after KISTI signed a Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) with the Korea University & College Library Association (KUCLA) and the Korea Special Library Association (KSLA) in 2021. In fact, 25 government-funded research institutes under the National Research Council of Science & Technology (NST) made transformative agreements with two major global publishers (Elsevier and Wiley) in 2021. Since then, the number of transformative agreements made with global publishers (Cambridge University Press, Royal Society of Chemistry, Karger, Company of Biologists, Institute of Physics, ACM, etc.) has increased in Korea. 
For domestic journals, the National Library of Korea, in cooperation with the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF), established the Korea Journal Copyright Information (KJCI) system in 2017; it helps share information on copyright policies of domestic journals, provides guidance and counseling on open access publishing to academic societies, and supports the conversion of journal content into a XML format. As a result, as of 2024, more than 15,000 articles from 128 domestic journals are available on the web in a JATS XML format. 
Plus, for science education and communication, the KAOS Foundation has developed video content in the field of basic science and delivered it to the public through KISTI’s ScieonceOn platform, based on a business agreement signed with KISTI in 2024. A citizen science organization, Nature Ring, has strengthened its collaborations with researchers from national research institutes, such as the National Institute of Ecology and the National Institute of Forest Science.

### B3.3: National Research and Education Network (NREN)
Yes. Edunet, a national education network, provides one-stop access to open education resources (OER) produced by 17 Offices of Education for elementary and middle school teaching and learning. Since 1996, Edunet has been operated by the Korea Education and Research Information Service (KERIS) with financial support from the Ministry of Education. 
KERIS also offers the Korea Open CourseWare (KOCW) service, which provides online courses created by Korean universities and continuing education institutions. In addition, the K-MOOC (Korea Massive Open Online Course) service is run by the National Institute for Lifelong Education. The National Library of Korea also provides open access training sessions to librarians and repository managers working in research organizations, schools, and public institutions through its education platform. 
Since 1998, KERIS has been operating the Research Information Sharing System (RISS), in which domestic researchers can search for and get access to the information on theses and dissertations of domestic universities, academic literature held by domestic libraries, and scholarly information acquired from overseas. 
Moreover, several networks for research exist. For instance, the Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information (KISTI) operates the Global Science Experimental Data Hub Center (GSDC) that supports access to the large amounts of experimental data produced by the world's largest particle accelerators (CERN, KEK) and giant observatories (LIGO). KISTI also provides the Korea Research Environment Open NETwork (KREONET) service. KREONET, a network for domestic researchers in the field of science and technology, is capable of transmitting a minimum of 200 Gbps and a maximum of 1.2 Tbps per section; it is based on 18 regional network centers nationwide and connected to the international research network through GLORIAD; it provides stable Internet services to about 200 network subscribers through IX at home and abroad.

### B3.4: Open science infrastructure (repositories, HPC, cloud)
Yes. There are many forms of digital infrastructure that support open science. First, the National Science and Technology Information Service (NTIS), designed to provide information on science and technology and national research and development projects, has operated since 2008. NTIS is regarded as a well-performing core facility that manages and disseminates R&D information at the national level, as stipulated in the Framework Act on Science and Technology; it has been awarded by diverse entities, including the UN Public Service Award in 2012. 
In addition, distinctive digital infrastructures serve specific open science activities, such as open access publishing and research data sharing. The Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information (KISTI) operates the AccessOn platform to support open access publishing. Through the platform, domestic research institutions and academic societies can not only search and utilize open access articles but also publish them. The Korea OA Journal service provided by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) enables users to search for and utilize all the open access contents from KCI-registered journals at once. The National Library of Korea, in charge of the Open Access Korea (OAK) project, has developed the OAK Repository Portal since 2014, which enables an integrated search for OAK (open access) repositories. 
To share and utilize research data, the Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information (KISTI) established the national research data platform, DataOn in 2020. DataOn allows us to search and utilize available research data in a unified manner. KISTI also developed research data management software, NaRDA, and has distributed it to domestic institutions; as a result, 23 public institutions have established their own repository systems based on NaRDA. In the field of bio-research, the Korea Bio Data Station (K-BDS) has been operating since 2022, and the Korea Materials Data Station (K-MDS) is in operation in the field of materials science. 
For open collaboration, KISTI has set up a platform, ScienceOn. The contents and services of ScienceOn are delivered via an effective API Gateway, such as OpenAPI and stOAI. Until early 2024, a total of 253 organizations (domestic research institutes, universities, public institutions, and companies) have used the ScienceOn API Gateway. 
In addition, the Korea DOI (Digital Object Identifier) Center, run by KISTI, provides an essential digital infrastructure service; it assigns a permanent unique identifier to digital content so that the content itself can be identified, searched, found and used with the identifier. As of August 2024, about 26 million DOIs have been assigned to publications and scientific data that are produced by about 1,600 organizations in Korea.

Partly yes. The curricula of library and information science departments at Korean universities began to incorporate teaching about open access publishing, research data management, and open science in general.

### B4.5: Science communication initiatives
Partly yes. In accordance with the Basic Plan on Science and Technology (2023-2027), the Korean government is supporting the expansion of science culture programs led by the private sector or local entities, the interactions between scientific communities and policymakers, and communications between scientists and the public. In particular, the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) supports the Korea Foundation for the Advancement of Science & Creativity (KOSAC) in operating ScienceAll as a medium for science communication. In addition, there exist several other citizen science platforms, including Nature Ring in the field of biodiversity. 
Furthermore, the Korean government released the 3rd Comprehensive Plan for Solving Social Problems Based on Science and Technology (2023-2027) and has made efforts to increase the contribution of national R&D programs to solving social problems. Nonetheless, no dedicated science communication project is exclusively focused on open science.

## B5: Research Assessment & Incentives

### B5.1: Review of research assessment processes
Partly yes. In accordance with the Act on the Performance Evaluation and Management of National Research and Development (R&D) Programs, the government is continuously reviewing  R&D results and improving evaluation methods in order to efficiently manage and utilize R&D outputs in the field of science and technology. As part of this, the 4th Basic Plan on National R&D Performance Evaluation (2021-2025) is currently being implemented. In order to overcome the shortcomings of previously dominant quantitative evaluation of publications, the government tends to emphasize qualitative evaluation of substantial research outcomes and process evaluation. However, no distinct evaluation mechanism is grounded in open science principles in existing national R&D programs.

### B5.2: Open science practices in career evaluation
Partly yes. The 4th Basic Plan on National R&D Performance Evaluation (2021-2025) recommends that social problem-solving R&D be evaluated by the alternative indicators on social impacts beyond academic outcomes. This encourages members of society beyond the scientific community to participate in the R&D evaluation process. Furthermore, public research institutions and government-affiliated agencies are required to provide their data and materials produced by public funds to societal members in a proactive manner under the Open Government Data policy;  a public organization’s performance on open government data is annually reviewed and evaluated. Nevertheless, it is not common to recognize and reward scientists’ efforts to collaborate with societal members outside a scientific community in the existing career development and promotion systems in science.

### B5.3: Initiatives to recognise/reward open science practices
Yes. The Minister of Science and ICT annually confers the Knowledge Sharing Award upon five outstanding researchers who have created and shared excellent academic achievements based on information collected from the National Science & Technology Information Service (NTIS). In addition, the Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism, through the National Library of Korea, has been presenting the Open Access Korea Merit Award since 2015 to individuals and organizations that have contributed to the expansion of open access movement.

### B5.4: Challenges and additional observations
Yes. Along with the growth of open access journals, the problems of predatory journals and conferences intensified. In order to prevent the negative consequences, the Center for Research Ethics (CRE) was established at the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) in 2020. The Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information (KISTI) also developed a system to identify predatory journals and operates a website, Scholarly Ecosystem Against Fake Publishing Environment (SAFE).

## B6: Societal Engagement & Open Innovation

### B6.1: Innovative participatory / societal engagement practices
Yes. There is a case of open research agenda-setting that occurred at the beginning of the research. In addition, the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) announced a plan to improve national R&D projects and related policies through the open participation of domestic academic societies at the “2023 General Meeting of Academic Societies for R&D Innovation.” 
Since 2005, the Korean government has required research facilities over a certain size purchased through national R&D projects to be registered to the National Research Facilities & Equipment Center (NFEC) and the registered information to be available to the public so that other researchers outside the project team can identify and utilize the registered facilities. 
ACOMS+ is a platform for article submission and review developed by the Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information (KISTI); it also supports open peer review for domestic journals. If a submitted paper is decided to go through open peer review, its review information becomes available upon publication.

## B7: International Cooperation

### B7.1: Promoting international scientific collaborations on open science
Yes. The Republic of  Korea is fully engaged in the process of shaping and implementing the UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science, including its involvement in the UNESCO Open Science Advisory Council from the early stage. The Korean government is expanding international cooperation on open science through multilateral meetings such as the OECD, G20, and APEC, joint committee meetings with partner countries, and high-level summits. 
At the institutional level, the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) collaborates with the Global Research Council (GRC) while discussing open science agenda. Moreover,  in response to COVID-19, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) participated in GISAID's data sharing. Korean researchers and experts are actively developing field-specific research collaboration networks across countries, and GloPID-R's APIS (Asis-Pacific Infectious Disease Shield) is one such example. Korean actors are also developing relevant regional Asia-Pacific networks, which include COAR (Confederation of Open Access Repositories) Asia, APRI (Asia Pacific Research Integrity), APAN (Asia Pacific Advanced Network), and STEPAN (Science, Technology, Engineering & Innovation Policy Asia and the Pacific Network). As part of APAN activities, the Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information (KISTI) is expanding partnerships with NII (National Institute of Informatics) of Japan and CSTCloud of China. KISTI is also enhancing its partnership with the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) and the Institute of Scientific and Technical Information of China (ISTIC), hosting a joint seminar on science and technology information every year. The National Library of Korea collaborates with the International Standard Name Identifier (ISNI) and the Virtual International Authority File (VIAF); it hosted an international event, the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI), at Kyungpook National University in 2022.
Regarding research data, Korean actors collaborate with RDA, CODATA, and WDS, whereas they work with COAR, OA2020, COALition S, and ICOLC for open access. In 2022, the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), KISTI, the National Library of Korea, the National Assembly Library, the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science, Sungkyunkwan University, the Seoul Metropolitan Government, the Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, and the Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources jointly hosted the International Data Week (IDW), a biennial event co-organized by RDA, CODATA, and WDS. 
The Republic of Korea has worked closely with UNESCO networks and entities for open science. From the beginning of the recommendation formation process, a Korean representative was involved in the UNESCO Open Science Advisory Council as a regional representative; even after the endorsement of the Recommendation, Korean experts have continued to participate in the five working groups on open science led by the UNESCO headquarters (secretariat). Korean actors also interact with UNESCO's regional offices (Jakarta, Beijing, etc.). As the vice chair of STEPAN, a Korean representative from the Science and Technology Policy Institute (STEPI) promotes open science implementation in the region. On top of that, KISTI recently initiated an international joint research project (scheduled from 2024 to 2029) with UNESCO headquarters to study how to vitalize global open science.

### B7.2: Cross-border multi-stakeholder collaboration strategy
Partly yes. The Korean government is implementing a national strategy for international STI cooperation, not limited to the promotion of open science. Specifically, in 2023, the Yoon administration proposed the "Strategy for Global R&D Leading the World" and the "R&D Innovation Strategy: Leaping to a Global Science and Technology (S&T) Hub Leading the World." Based on those strategies, the government is promoting global research collaboration, particularly in the field of critical and emerging technologies, and enhancing research environments aligned with global standards. As a result, cross-border multi-stakeholder collaborations related to open science are indirectly being fostered, even if they are not explicitly stated as open science collaborations.
