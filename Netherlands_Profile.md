## B2 – Open Science Policies and Governance

### B2.1 — Share a machine-readable PDF file of the policy

Brief context: The Dutch Research Council NWO and several academic institutions and other stakeholders in the Netherlands have been early adopters of open science. At national and European level open science gained momentum when the Netherlands put open science on the agenda of the Netherlands’ Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2016. Under this Presidency, Council Conclusions on the transition towards an open science system5 were adopted and the Amsterdam Call for Action on Open Science6 was launched. Since then, the Netherlands’ government, in the STI paragraphs of two consecutive coalition agreements (2016-20217 and 2021-20258), has stated that open science should become the norm in scientific research. Under the current government (2024-20289) the existing open science policies are being continued. Several national policy letters, strategies and actions on STI have followed from these coalition agreements. The two main overarching science and research policy letters (from 201910 and 2022), from which the current open science policies followed, are mentioned below. o Title of the policy: Higher Education and Science Policy o Authority in charge of development of the policy: Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (please note that science and research policy, including open science, is under the responsibility of the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science. The Ministry of Economic Affairs is responsible for Technology and Innovation policy. The two ministries work closely together.) o Entities involved and the process of development: All relevant stakeholder organisations in the Netherlands o Year of adoption: 2022 o Key areas/sections of the policy major science and research policy topics are described along the lines of 3 objectives: • Objective 1: Strong and healthy foundations • Objective 2: Creating scope for a wide range of talent • Objective 3: Increasing the societal impact of higher education and research [open science is part of this section of the policy letter] o Links to the webpage www.government.nl/documents/parliamentary-documents/2022/06/17/letter-to-parliament-about-higher-education-and-science-policy  // • does it include any of the following open science elements: Please note that the open science section of the afore mentioned policy letter is only brief. More detailed open science dedicated policy letters, documents and initiatives followed from this letter. o open access to scientific knowledge: Yes o open science infrastructure: Yes o open engagement of societal actors: Yes o open dialogue with other knowledge systems: Not specifically mentioned in this concise policy letter

### B2.2 — Please share a machine-readable PDF file(s) of the policy(ies) and provide the following information for each: Title of the policy or legal instrument, the authority in charge of development of the policy, entities involved and the process of development, year of adoption, year of last update, key areas/sections of the policy, elements of open science that are addressed, and links to the webpage(s) if available

It offers the (personal) right to researchers in the Netherlands to freely share their publicly funded research outputs by means of a repository, following a `reasonable period of time’. Via the pilot project `You share, we take care’ in 2019, the universities of the Netherlands have defined this `reasonable period of time’ as 6 months for the Version of Record, and that eligible outputs are articles and book chapters. All universities have developed workflows which help researchers to make their output openly available via this route. Many of them have adopted opt-out policies, meaning that publications by authors affiliated with Dutch universities are automatically deposited in the institutional repositories and made available unless a researcher decides to opt out. The policy is highly effective, resulting in almost 100% open access rates for many Dutch institutions. The Dutch Research Council (NWO) is a Plan S signatory, which means the cOAltion S Rights Retention Strategy is an eligible route

• In the current (and previous) administrative agreement between the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science and the universities regarding the allocation of the lump sum financial resources, it is agreed that `the institutions will continue to make open science and open education the norm because, in addition to knowledge utilization and impact, this also leads to better quality education and research’.12 • In addition, the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science provides funding (80 million euro in total) for the Open Science NL programme, which is the national initiative for Open Science in the Netherlands, running a 10-year (2023-2031) funding program to make open science the norm in Dutch research by 2031. Open Science NL uses these funds to stimulate various aspects of the Open Science agenda. The current work plan period funding is aimed at the following priority areas: 1. Capacity building, 2. Infrastructure for Open Science, 3. Robust research processes, 4. Evidence base for Open Science, 5. Empowering communities. Under these areas a wide range of calls are being opened to addresses a comprehensive set of needs and challenges relating to open science, from supporting from strengthening and supporting local and thematic digital competence centres, national training for datastewardship, open science infrastructure, citizen science hubs, institutional (diamond) open access, open and sustainable research software, the recognition and rewards of open science, replication studies and research into open research. [www.openscience.nl/calls] • In 2020 NWO launched the Open Science Fund that aims to support projects specifically designed to implement and stimulate open science practices. With this funding instrument (grants) NWO has taken a step forward towards changing the way academics are recognised and rewarded in the Netherlands. There was a second round of funding in 2022-2023.

### B2.7 — Please provide details and links as relevant

• Since January 2021 the principles of Plan S, the initiative of European research funders to accelerate the transition to open access, have been applying to all NWO/ZonMw calls since that date.13 • All NWO grantees are required to make their publications available Open Access and their research datasets as open and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) as possible. Furthermore, all grantees are required to submit a data management plan reviewed by a data steward before the start of the project. • The Dutch Research Council (NWO) has signed DORA in 2019 and has implemented in principles across all its research funding mechanisms. This means three actions in practice: 1. References to Journal Impact Factors and the h-index have been banned in all call texts and application forms; 2. Applicants, referees and committee members are actively informed about the policy changes that follow from the signing of DORA; 3. NWO has introduced the evidence-based CV (formerly a narrative CV).

### B2.8 — Please provide details and links as relevant

For about a decade the Universities in the Netherlands (UNL), the Netherlands Federation of University Medical Centres (NFU) and the Dutch Research Council (NWO) have been negotiating (transformative) `read and publish’ agreements with scientific publishers. The overview of current agreements can be found here: www.openaccess.nl/en/publishing/publisher-deals. Efforts have been made to foster the equitability of these agreements and cooperation with publishers, e.g. initiatives worth mentioning: • Seven Guiding Principles for Open Research Information (2022): a document for research organisations to adopt when creating and procuring services to manage research information. It was drafted to address issues around the responsible use of research information and the role of commercial third party providers in particular. [https://zenodo.org/records/6074944] • Conference (2024) to explore the successes and challenges of the `read and publish’ deals; cooperation with publishers in the field of research information and how concepts such as `digital sovereignty’ play out in relationships with commercial publishers.

## B4 – Education, Capacity Building & Science Communication

### B4.1 — Please indicate if those capacity building initiatives are formal or informal and provide more information and links as relevant

Open Science NL supports capacity building in higher education and research performing institutions. In the Open Science NL Work programme 2024-2025 in Chapter 1, which is dedicated to Capacity Building, it is stated: “Investing in capacity building for open science is one of the essential requirements for putting open science into practice. In this document, capacity building refers to the process of enhancing the organisational or community-based knowledge, skills and abilities needed to adopt open science practices effectively. In other words, capacity building refers to investment in people and their skills. Capacity building initiatives provide much needed training and support to navigate the technical, legal, social, cultural and ethical aspects of open science, thereby enabling communities to overcome barriers and embrace new approaches. Ultimately, capacity building strengthens the foundations of sustainable open science ecosystems, which encompass not only specific research outputs (publications, data software and non-traditional research output, such as creative works, policy reports, etc.), but also research processes, infrastructures and research cultures. Over the past few years NWO has already been investing in capacity building at the institutional level, mainly through calls to support digital competence centres: Local Digital Competence Centres (LDCCs) and Thematic Digital Competence Centres (TDCCs). The four funding programmes proposed here will build on these earlier initiatives to further stimulate the capacity building for open science: Over the past few years NWO has already been investing in capacity building at the institutional level, mainly through calls to support digital competence centres: Local Digital Competence Centres (LDCCs)8 and Thematic Digital Competence Centres (TDCCs). The four funding programmes proposed here will build on these earlier initiatives to further stimulate the capacity building for open science: 1.1. National Training Platform for Research Data Professionals – providing national-level training and community support for aspiring data professionals. 1.2. Strengthening local and thematic Digital Competence Centres – increasing software training capacity and investing in interoperability of research data. 1.3. Citizen Science Hubs – fostering the creation of regional hubs with citizen science and societal engagement expertise. – 1.4. Enabling and strengthening institutional open publishing – supporting networks and building expertise in non-profit, university-based publishing venues. Overall budget in 2024-2025: €22.4M ” Source: www.openscience.nl/en/news/open-science-nl-presents-work-programme-for-2024-and-2025 pages 7-9 • See on the website of the various higher education and research performing institutions mentioned under question 2.5. for specific examples at institutional level

### B4.2 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

Not so much capacity building programmes dedicated specifically to policy makers, however a huge effort is being made by institutions to build capacity (and knowledge) through networks and communities (e.g., library working groups, RDM networks and Open Science Communities and Citizen Science-NL).

### B4.3 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

Such a framework could possibly be something for UNESCO to (help) develop. In the Netherlands, at institutional level most universities offer courses, primarily at PhD- and research MA- level. Some examples: • Erasmus University: Course on Open Science and Research Transparency www.eur.nl/en/egsh/course/open-science-and-research-transparency • Utrecht University- www.uu.nl/en/education/graduate-school-of-life-sciences/phd/starting-your-phd/responsibilities-of-phd- candidates/open-science • TU Delft: https://online-learning.tudelft.nl/courses/open-science-sharing-your-research-with-the-world/ • Leiden University - Open Science, A practical guide for early career researchers (2023) www.library.universiteitleiden.nl/news/2023/06/now-available-open-science-a-practical-guide-for-early-career-researchers Open Science NL provides practical information and inspiration to knowledge institutions and researchers. www.openscience.nl/praktische-informatie-inspiratie At national level such a framework does not exist, as the Netherlands does not know a national curriculum.

### B4.5 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

This is being done e.g. by the National Expert Centre for Science and Society (NEWS) that was established in 2024. https://wetenschapensamenleving.nl/index.php/over-ons-2

## B5 – Research Assessment and Incentives

### B5.1 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

Open Science NL has in December 2024 awarded €1.14 million to 24 research institutions in order to embed open science in recruitment and promotion criteria. A further €150k was awarded to support national coordination: www.openscience.nl/en/news/knowledge-institutions-take-action-on-open-science-in-recruitment-and-promotion-policies Dutch universities, university medical centers, research institutes and research funders have collectively launched the national Recognition & Rewards Programme in 2019. The programme aims to achieve a new balance in the way academics are recognized and rewarded. One of the five main ambitions is to stimulate all aspects of open science in the assessment and evaluation of academics. In 2023, the public research institutions set the goal to (further) clarify how activities relating to open science and open education will be considered and/or prioritised as a topic of discussion in the development, assessment, appointment, and promotion of staff. Within the institutions, teams are actively working on and with the principles of open science and FAIRification. The institutions aim to make sure employees’ efforts in open science will be part of the evaluation and annual appraisal interview. The Recognition & Rewards Programme is co-funded by the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (2022-2026). See: https://recognitionrewards.nl/about/about-the-programme/ https://recognitionrewards.nl/about/roadmap/

### B5.2 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

All aspects of open science are promoted within the national Recognition and Rewards programme. (See the answer to question 5.2). Some institutions have formally adopted the principles of open science into evaluation procedures. For example: • At Maastricht University, impact & open science is a mandatory part of assessment of all senior academics (R3-R4). www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/file/assistantassociateandfullprofessorprofileinclengpdf • At VU Amsterdam, open science, like academic integrity, is conditional to performance assessments and promotion. https://assets-us-01.kc-usercontent.com/d8b6f1f5-816c-005b-1dc1-e363dd7ce9a5/de3480c3-3962-4a3e-a934- b61fe6deb90e/Academic%20Careerpath%202023%20VU_EN.pdf • At Utrecht University, the promotion profile for Professor 1 (R4) requires the Professor 1 to “use their own position to actively promote Open Science” www.uu.nl/sites/default/files/Promotion-Profile-and-Procedure-Prof-1-EN.pdf

### B5.3 — For each initiative, please provide more information, including on the stakeholders[i] that are involved or lead the initiative, and links as relevant.

• All aspects of open science are promoted within the national Recognition and Rewards programme. See the answer to questions 5.2 and 5.3. • Various Open Science Awards, e.g.: https://opensciencefestival.nl/en/news/who-will-be-the-winner-of-the-first-leo-waaijers-open-science-award https://vu.nl/nl/nieuws/2023/vu-open-science-challenge-award-2023-voor-8-projecten www.hva.nl/subsites/nl/hva-bibliotheek/nieuws/2024/04/oproep-voor-open-science-awards-2024.html www.medewerkers.universiteitleiden.nl/nieuws/2022/11/open-science-prijs-voor-anne-urai-en-collegas • Research Data Netherlands (RDNL) has been organising every two years the Dutch Data Prize. The prize is awarded to an individual or a team that makes research data FAIR: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. The Dutch Data Prize is awarded in three categories: Social Sciences and Humanities; Natural and Engineering Sciences; Life Sciences and Health. • CWTS overview article `Monitoring Open Science in The Netherlands’ (2025), including references to the UNESCO Open Science Recommendation: www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/monitoring-open-science-in-the-netherlands

### B5.4 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

No reported unintended negative consequences. However, the (international) shift from `pay to read’ to `pay to publish’ business models, including risen Article Processing Costs may be an example here. For the Global South this shift is even harder to bear. The UNESCO Chair at CWTS on Diversity and Inclusion in Global Science is -among other things- looking into this.

## B6 – Engagement of Societal Actors & Open Innovation

### B6.1 — Indicate which of the recommended actions they address

YES, at both national and institutional levels, e.g.: • Dutch Research Agenda: Citizens are at the heart of creating and renewing the Dutch Research Agenda. The link between society and science is a key element of the NWA programme. Governments, researchers, civil society organisations and citizens work together to develop and use knowledge to achieve scientific and societal impact. And through science communication, knowledge is shared in society to increase engagement and trust in science. www.nwo.nl/en/researchprogrammes/dutch-research-agenda-nwa https://wetenschapsagenda.nl/ • Open Science NL: several of its funding instruments are aiming at this. www.openscience.nl/ OS NL works closely together with and receives input from the institutional level. • Citizen Science NL as the national network (https://citizenscience.nl/) and Citizen Science Hubs at institutional level aiming at participatory activities. (www.openscience.nl/en/researchprogrammes/citizen-science-hubs)

### B6.1 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

• promotion of pre-prints and exploration of open peer-review practices: - this is being addressed ad hoc at different institutional levels, see for example: www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/news/2023/10/posting-preprints-there-is-no-reason-not-to www.staff.universiteitleiden.nl/news/2024/02/open-and-free-peer-review-heres-how - or through guidance, see: https://zenodo.org/records/5600535 - quite a few institutions are actively supporting infrastructure for preprints and open peer reviews. E.g., all universities and NWO are supporting ArXiv. - there is currently no policy (or mandate) for preprints in the Netherlands, but this is being discussed. • valuing and sharing of negative scientific results and associated data: - this is being addressed in different communities. There is even a journal originated from the Netherlands, addressing this topic specifically: https://journal.trialanderror.org/ • participatory methods that value inputs from societal actors, e.g. citizen science, crowdsourcing scientific project: - Dutch Research Agenda: it is a participatory method in itself. - Citizen Science NL (citizenscience.nl) and its knowledge platform • development of participatory strategies for identifying the needs of marginalized communities and highlighting socially relevant issues to be incorporated into research agendas. This is incorporated in the Dutch Research Agenda

## B7 – International Cooperation

### B7.1 — How is your country promoting and facilitating international scientific collaborations on open science as outlined in the 2021 Recommendation on Open Science?

NWO has been providing financial support for the key international infrastructures for open science: www.nwo.nl/en/open-science-infrastructure-support   In recent years, several university libraries have set up dedicated funds for supporting (inter)national infrastructures to support open science (e.g., www.uu.nl/en/university-library/advice-support-to/researchers/publishing- support/open-access/open-access-in-practice/diamond-open-access). Strengthening the coordination and developing collective funding mechanisms is currently underway

### B7.2 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

In several of the letters to Parliament mentioned under question 2.2. it is stated that the Netherlands will continue to play an active role in cross-border (multi-stakeholder) collaboration on open science. The Netherlands does so e.g.: • via its membership of, or affiliation with, various multilateral organisations, such as the European Union, the OECD, UNESCO (e.g. the Netherlands in 2024 donated € 100.000,- to UNESCO for the implementation of the Recommendation on Open Science) and the G20. • via bilateral (high-level) contacts, including in the follow-up to Memoranda of Understanding in the field of science and research that were signed in recent years with several countries, in the Global North as well as the Global South, in which open science is mentioned as a topic for (further) cooperation.

### B7.3 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

NWO is financially supporting the Global Research Initiative on Open Science (GRIOS - https://grios.org/), which aims to review the existing evidence and ongoing research on open science.

## B8 – Other

### B8.1 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

It is the ambition of the Dutch government that open science will be the norm in scientific research in the Netherlands by the year 2032. Although, due to upcoming general budget cuts, there will be less budget available for the transition to open science than initially anticipated, the ambition remains unchanged.
