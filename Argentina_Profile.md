## B2 – Open Science Policies and Governance

### B2.1 — Share a machine-readable PDF file of the policy

The National STI Plan 2030 that was passed into law in October 2023 (Law 27.738). The former Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation was responsible for developing the plan, and the provinces were involved in its preparation.  The Plan seeks to address 10 national challenges (aligned with the UN SDG) with 4 different types of agendas (strategic, territorial, crosscutting and institutional change agendas). Elements of Open Science appear in these agendas, mainly in the section “Citizenship and Scientific Culture” where emphasis is placed on Open Access and Citizen Science. Link: National Science, Technology and Innovation Plan  2030.  A Guideline for implementing the Plan is under development.

### B2.2 — Please share a machine-readable PDF file(s) of the policy(ies) and provide the following information for each: Title of the policy or legal instrument, the authority in charge of development of the policy, entities involved and the process of development, year of adoption, year of last update, key areas/sections of the policy, elements of open science that are addressed, and links to the webpage(s) if available

In 2013 Argentina passed the Law 26.899 of Open Access Institutional Digital Repositories. This Law was implemented in 2016 by Resolution 753 - E/2016 of the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation. This Law establishes a regulatory framework for the Open Access policy at the national level. It mandates that public bodies and institutions within the National Science, Technology and Innovation System (SNCTI), receiving funding from the National Government, develop digital institutional repositories in open access. These repositories, whether individually owned or shared, must comply with international interoperability standards. They are intended to collect scientific and technological results from work, training, and/or projects wholly or partially funded by public funds. All such results must be deposited in these repositories. Furthermore, the Law requires the establishment of policies to ensure public access to primary research data. This will be achieved through open access digital institutional repositories or national portals for large instruments and database systems. It also mandates institutional policies for the long-term management and preservation of these resources.

### B2.3 — Please provide details and links as relevant, including for each instrument: Title of the instrument, its objective, the authority in charge, allocated budget, elements of open science included

Several programs of the Under Secretariat of Science and Technology of the Secretariat of Innovation, Science and Technology promote open science or a number of elements of open science: The National System of Digital Repositories (SNRD), created in 2011, is an initiative that aims at developing an interoperable network of S&T digital repositories by establishing common policies, standards and protocols for all members of the National S&T System. The initiative partially funds projects for creating or strengthening digital repositories; the production of these repositories is harvested by the National Digital Repositories System portal. This instrument promotes open access.  Connected with this policy, the Open Access Primary Data Portal for Science and Technology in Argentina (DACyTAr) was created in 2020. Allows users to search and access primary research data in open access through digital institutional repositories included in the SNRD in a centralized manner. The National Citizen Science Program was created in 2022 by Ministerial Resolution 620/2022 and aims to promote Citizen Scienze all over Argentina by contributing to the development of CC initiatives, raising awareness, promoting joint construction of knowledge and active participation of societal actors in the various stages of CC initiatives. This instrument promotes citizen science as an element of open science. National Systems promote an efficient use of large equipment and facilities. The National Science, Technology and Innovation System (SNCTI) institutions that enrol their equipment and instruments in the Program are required to make them available to third-party users for 20% of the available time. This initiative, created in 2008, promotes a shared use of scientific infrastructure, which is a step in the right direction to achieve open infrastructures in line with open science.

### B2.4 — Please provide details and links as relevant, including the name of ministries and national authorities/entities, as well as affiliated organizations that are involved in the development and implementation of the plan, strategy or the roadmap

An Advisory Open and Citizen Science Committee was set up in 2021 by Ministerial Resolution 132/2021, made up of members from various disciplines and institutions (MINCYT, CONICET, Universities and other S&T organizations). In 2022 the Committee issued a Diagnosis and Lineaments for an Open Science Policy in Argentina, including a number of recommendations. This document provides elements to consider as a baseline for a National Open Science Strategy, the roadmap of which is planned to be developed shortly.

### B2.5 — Please provide more information, including the number of policies, name of the institute(s) that has/have developed the policy(s) and elements of open science included in the policy (please consider policies and strategies addressing all elements of open science, including citizen
and participatory  science, or co-production of knowledge with multiple actors).

Law 26.899 promotes the implementation of open access policy by the National Science, Technology and Innovation System (SNCTI) institutions. Among the institutions, public and private, under the scope of the Law, 18 have already implemented such policies and 13 have draft versions (in addition, we registered 18 institutions that have some form of Open Access mandate). Likewise, 81 institutions have at least one digital repository in operation. Considering only public universities and the main national science and technology organizations, our survey shows that out of 91 institutions, 51.6% have at least one active digital repository, while 29.7% do not have a repository but offer journals, publications, and/or open data on their websites. From these results, we infer that there is still work to be done in the field of Open Access. Likewise, a number of universities have included elements of open science, mainly in connection to open access, to their strategic plans, for example Strategic Plan 2022-2026 of Universidad Nacional de La Plata, Participatory Strategic Plan 2030 of Universidad Nacional de Mar del Plata, Institutional Project 2016-2022 of Universidad Nacional de San Antonio de Areco and Strategic Plan and Institutional Development Plan 2016-2020 of Universidad Nacional de La Pampa.

### B2.6 — Please provide details and links as relevant

Specific funding mechanisms include:  The National Citizen Science Program aims at funding Argentine Citizen Science programs and projects, from the ideation stage to improvement and scaling up (among other objectives, such as mapping and monitoring CS programs and projects, encouraging the participation of civil society and promoting training, research and diagnoses related to CS). A call was launched in 2023. The National System of Digital Repositories aims to provide financial support for creating and/or strengthening digital repositories and for the training of human resources. National Systems aims to support institutions for upgrading equipment, purchasing supplementary equipment and Human Resources training, under the vision of shared use of instruments. Federal Program “Equipping Science” awarded funds to beneficiaries to purchase medium size and large equipment. Beneficiary institutions undertook to enrol their instruments in the National Systems program and comply with the Open Access Law. The most recent evaluation of applications took place in 2023.

### B2.7 — Please provide details and links as relevant

Some funding awarded by the Under Secretariat of Science and Technology and the Agencia I+D+i usually requires beneficiaries to comply with the Open Access and Digital Repositories Law, as can be seen in the 2022 and 2023 Calls for applications for Science and Technology research projects, the National Systems Program and the Federal Program “Equipping Science”.  Particularly for funds awarded by the National Digital Repositories System, the beneficiary institution must have in place an Institutional Open Access Policy in line with the provisions of Law 26.899 and its implementation regulation. A number of national programs require collaboration between researchers and institutions and between them and local societal actors. These include Impacting Program for R&D projects that provide a solutions to public interest problems; Interinstitutional Centers in Strategic Subjects and Scientific and Technological Facilities Program that funds the creation of centers on strategic issues and large facilities, equipment and infrastructure projects (in both programs, at least 3 S&T institutions are involved and local and provincial entities may also be part of the project). At institutional level, several examples include Research and Development Projects 2025 – Universidad Nacional de La Plata that requires beneficiaries to comply with Law 26.899 and university open access institutional policies; the rules for the UBACYT grants of  Universidad de Buenos Aires that mandates compliance with institutional repository requirements; the terms of the Call for Technological and Social Linkage Projects 2024 of the Universidad Nacional de los Comechingones that require projects to include specific territorial stakeholders for eligibility thus promoting collaboration with local societal actors and local communities.

### B2.8 — Please provide details and links as relevant

CONICET is currently developing efforts to foster equitable public-private partnerships on open science; however no document has yet been published online.

### B2.9 — Please provide details and links as relevant

Specific indicators on open science are under development. Argentina has an Integrated S&T Indicators System under the scope of the National Directorate of Information and Studies. Surveys about R&D and innovation are regularly conducted at academic, governmental and company level. The National Directorate of Information and Studies is at present developing an Open Science Monitor; as a first step towards that project, a Monitor for Law 26.899 is currently underway. Of note, in 2023 the first National Mapping of Citizen Science Initiatives was conducted.This  provided information on the number of projects, actors involved, geographical distribution, etc. of Citizen Science initiatives.
