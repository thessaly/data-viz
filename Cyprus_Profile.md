## B1 – Promotion of the UNESCO 2021 Recommendation on Open Science

### B1.1 — If yes, please indicate which ministries and or national authorities/entities have been involved in the promotion of the 2021 Recommendation

The Ministry of Education, Sport and Youth

### B1.3 — If yes, please provide details on the activities organized or foreseen and links as relevant

The Cyprus National Policy for Open Science Practices delegates the responsibility for the skills and training actions to Libraries. As part of the collaboration between the Greek and Cyprus OpenAIRE NOADs, the University of Cyprus Library organises regular webinar series covering a variety of OS aspects including legal topics, services, infrastructure, policies, citizen science, DMPs etc. The main goal of these training sessions is to fill any potential knowledge gaps of any type of stakeholders including researchers, policymakers, funders, librarians, and citizens/ general public audience that are interested in the topic. The webinars are always open to the public. A significant amount of training material and recordings was created in Greek and are openly available and easily accessible through the UCY Library Institutional Repository GNOSIS. https://gnosis.library.ucy.ac.cy/. In addition, since 2009 the University of Cyprus Library is participating in European projects and acting as the only National Open Access Desk (NOAD) of OpenAIRE in the country and is actively involved to the promotion and transmission of knowledge regarding Open Science aspects. Since then, every year the University of Cyprus Library is organising numerous webinars and conferences or other face to face events to raise awareness and provide the necessary Open Science knowledge to different stakeholders.  The case of the UCY Library has been included as a use case in the Brochure of Use Cases on EOSC and Open Science https://zenodo.org/records/10822698  Additional material: https://yerun.eu/2023/10/advocating-open-science-through-educational-actions/

## B3 – Open Science Infrastructure

### B3.1 — What is the latest official data for your country’s percentage of national gross domestic product (GDP) dedicated to research and development expenditure? Please also indicate the year of publication of this data, and to which year(s) it refers.

2022: 0.89 of GDP

### B3.2 — What is the latest official data for the percentage of your country's population that have access to reliable internet and bandwidth? Please also indicate the year of publication of this data, and to which year(s) it refers

Cyprus - Level of internet access was 94.92% in December of 2024, according to the EUROSTAT. Also check: https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2024-cyprus

### B3.3 — Please provide more information and links as relevant, and indicate to which open science actors in your country those networks are accessible

CYPRIOT RESEARCH AND ACADEMIC NETWORK, https://cynet.ac.cy/contact/

### B3.4 — For each infrastructure, please provide links as relevant and more information with regard to their compliance with the 2021 Recommendation on Open Science in terms of inclusivity, accessibility, interoperability, community governance, FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) and CARE (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility and Ethics) principles. Please indicate if the infrastructure is non-commercial

There are several institutional research data repositories, however they are mainly hosting publication outputs and only few provide services for other open access material such as data sets and open-source software. The situation is better with institutional digital storage systems that are mainly used to store and provide internal access to the institution's publication outputs or the institution's section.  The Deputy Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digital Policy  has initiated actions for the creation of a national infrastructure / repository which are expected to be further implemented within the next 2 years. This project promotes the creation of a national scale repository, a project that is expected to be completed within the next two years.

### B3.5 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so.

Yes

## B4 – Education, Capacity Building & Science Communication

### B4.1 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so.

The National OS Policy encourages the research stakeholders to embed OS practices recruitment, research assessment and evaluation criteria and promotes the adoption of incentives and rewards of researchers who use OS practices. A systemic approach is far beyond the current situation in most of the academic and research performing institutions in the country. However, there are collaborations with public libraries for the promotion of Citizen Science initiatives and funding mechanisms such as "Cyprus University of Technology Open Access Author Fund".  In addition, the libraries in Cyprus participate in the Consortium and Cyprus Association of Librarians – Information Scientists - CALIS for Open Science, supervised by the Deputy Ministry of Research, Innovation, and Digital Policy of Cyprus.
