YES Angola is taking steps to develop a strategy for cross-border, multi-stakeholder collaboration on open science, with efforts focused on exchange of best practices, capacity building, and open science metrics. While a fully formalized national strategy is still in progress, several initiatives contribute to this goal. Key Initiatives and Plans:  1.	Regional and International Collaboration Angola is aligning its policies with UNESCO's 2021 Open Science Recommendation and engaging with Redalyc/AmeliCA, to foster international collaboration.  https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/angola-committed-enhance-capacities-open-access-scientific-information https://scienceeurope.org/events/announcing-the-global-diamond-open-access-alliance/  https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/announcing-global-diamond-open-access-alliance https://globaldiamantoa.org/en/home-2/ https://doasummit.uct.ac.za/ https://www.goap.info/oa-for-angola  https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/angola-committed-enhance-capacities-open-access-scientific-information  https://amelica.org/  2.	Capacity Building and Training on Open Science Angolan universities and research institutions have launched training programs to enhance researchers' skills in open science practices. Government-backed initiatives encourage knowledge-sharing and networking between Angolan and international research institutions.  Challenges and Future Directions:  Lack of a formalized national open science strategy remains an obstacle. Limited funding and digital infrastructure hinder broader participation. Plans are in place to expand training, enhance collaboration with international institutions, and develop open science policy frameworks.

Angola is committed to strengthening open science in both the Global South and North, considering its advantages for scientific and technological development. Since 2020, Angola has collaborated with strategic internal and external partners, such as UNESCO, Redalyc/AmeliCA, MESCTI, the National Commission of Angola for UNESCO, and higher education institutions, all focused on discussing and proposing solutions to ensure that scientific knowledge produced with public funds is accessible and recognized as a common public good.  Angola's active participation in discussions on global interest topics at the First and Second Global Summit on Diamond Open Access in Toluca (Mexico) and South Africa, alongside international organizations, demonstrates its commitment to this cause.  The fact that Angola was recently recognized as a model country in sharing best practices in open science further reinforces our collective commitment to promoting this agenda. This recognition not only highlights the progress made but also challenges us to consolidate and expand initiatives that strengthen science, technology, and innovation in the country and across the African continent. To reverse current indicators and contribute positively to Africa’s scientific and technological development, it is essential to intensify efforts in formulating and implementing effective open science policies, ensuring adequate infrastructure, sustainable funding, and greater collaboration between educational institutions, research bodies, and the government.
