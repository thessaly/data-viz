## B1 – Promotion of the UNESCO 2021 Recommendation on Open Science

### B1.1 — If yes, please indicate which ministries and or national authorities/entities have been involved in the promotion of the 2021 Recommendation

Canadian federal government departments and agencies were made aware of the 2021 UNESCO Recommendation during its development and when it was finalized. During the development of the 2021 Recommendation, Canada set up a working group composed of key actors in federal open science to inform negotiations of the Recommendation. The Canadian Commission for UNESCO (CCUNESCO), a Canadian federal organization, was also involved in drafting the 2021 Recommendation and provided contributions from civil society (e.g., from the Open Science Beyond Open Access: For and with communities report). Information on the 2021 Recommendation’s approval was also circulated within the federal government’s open science community. It was discussed in venues such as the Deputy Ministers’ Roadmap for Open Science Steering Committee, as part of a review of the international open science landscape. In Quebec, the provincial government is involved in promoting and sharing the 2021 Recommendation through the Fonds de recherche du Québec (FRQ), open data resources available online (À propos – Données Québec) (in French only), a government open data portal (Données Québec) (in French only), and the Quebec-wide programming competition known as HackQC (in French only

### B1.2 — If yes, which language(s)?

English and French

### B1.3 — If yes, please provide details on the activities organized or foreseen and links as relevant

Numerous open science awareness activities and initiatives have been organized across Canadian federal departments and agencies. In particular, the Open Science Action Plans Page 6 of 40 from 12 federal departments and agencies, now publicly available, help raise awareness of open science. (see Section 2.5). Other Canadian federal initiatives include. • Environment and Climate Change Canada maintains internet and intranet sites on open science and has set up an internal working group to increase awareness of and implement open science in the department. • Natural Resources Canada established an Open Science Committee in 2021 to oversee the department’s open science activities. The Open Science Committee meets regularly to discuss, update and share information and ideas on open science issues, and has organized awareness sessions for its scientists and senior management. • The Canadian Space Agency is involved in organizing and participating in public activities such as hackathons, school STEM initiative, seminars, and grants to share insights and maximize the impact of scientific engagements. Some examples include the annual Space Apps Challenge hackathon and the Grant for Space STEM initiatives. • The Public Health Agency of Canada established an internal Open Science Community of Practice to raise awareness of open access publications and communication of citizen science. This has included establishing a website with open science resources and publishing an open science quarterly newsletter. The Public Health Agency of Canada also joined the ORCID Canada Consortium to promote and measure open scholarly communication. • Health Canada informs employees of open science-related activities through the intranet, intradepartmental announcements and an annual Health Canada Science Forum. Health Canada also promotes awareness of the Open Access Fund, a departmental fund that ensures scientific publications are open and freely accessible at the time of their publication. • Ongoing efforts are underway at Fisheries and Oceans Canada to enhance communication and promotion of science externally to stakeholders, Indigenous partners and Canadians. In 2024, Fisheries and Oceans Canada launched a new strategic approach to science engagement, including updated governance and targeted deliverables. Activities included renewing the departmental website and organizing stakeholder engagement activities. • The Canadian Food Inspection Agency has actively raised awareness of open science through initiatives such as revising its Scientific Publication Policy to incorporate open science principles and participating in interdepartmental meetings to share insights on its benefits and challenges. Other activities: In 2020, CCUNESCO, in collaboration with the UNESCO Chair in Community-Based Research and Social Responsibility in Higher Education at the University of Victoria, hosted a nine-part global webinar series entitled Open Science and the Decolonization of Knowledge to raise awareness of open science and gather perspectives from around the world, including from nearly 20 Indigenous Elders and scholars. In 2022, CCUNESCO partnered with UNESCO to publish a plain language introduction to the 2021 Recommendation, and shared the open-source files with other National Commissions to UNESCO to republish in their respective countries and languages. This brochure outlines Page 7 of 40 the principles and practices of open science and provides a summary of the UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science as an international framework aimed at reducing the technological and knowledge divide between and within countries. It articulates the need for open science and its potential to accelerate response to the global challenges of our time. Awareness-raising activities have also been organized in recent years by the Province of Quebec. For example, data promotion activities took place during the Autorité des marchés financiers’ Semaine de la donnée in 2021. The Commission de l’éthique en science et en technologie published “Éthique hebdo” (weekly ethics) posts about the benefits and risks of open science in the context of COVID-19 (in French only) and about the benefits and ethical risks of sharing scientific data (in French only) in 2020 and 2022. In 2021, the Commission published a discussion paper on the use of scientific data by public decision makers in a democratic society and ethical considerations (in French only) that examines the benefits and risks of open science. Lastly, the Commission de l’éthique en science et en technologie presented this work to the Quebec (provincial) government and during international events such as the Philosophy Around the World – Worldwide Philosophical Relay Race that was organized by UNESCO in 2021.

### B1.4 — If yes, please indicate the actions that are taken to incorporate the specific values and principles. For each case, please provide details and links as relevant

Government of Canada (federal) departments and agencies that conduct science and research have implemented actions to incorporate open science principles and values. The 2020 Roadmap for Open Science, developed by the Office of the Chief Science Advisor, provides overarching principles and recommendations to guide federal open science activities in Canada, including publicly funded research. Recommendation #3 of the Roadmap called for Government of Canada (federal) departments and agencies to develop action plans for open science, and 12 federal departments and agencies have published their action plans. These action plans have led to more specific actions within federal departments and agencies to incorporate open science values and principles in their research. Recent federal departmental science strategies are also aligned with this direction. For example, Environment and Climate Change Canada’s Science Strategy 2024-2029, which provides direction for mandate-driven science carried out by the department, emphasizes the importance of transparency in its work, achieved in part through open science. The Public Health Agency of Canada’s Science Strategy (2024) similarly prioritizes open and transparent science communication and collaborative approaches to democratize knowledge, and to make public health evidence accessible to all. The Health Canada Framework for Science and Research Excellence (2022) also values open science approaches in federal government research. Additionally, Recommendation #4 in the Roadmap for Open Science called for federal departments and agencies to make federal science articles and publications openly Page 8 of 40 accessible, and advised departments to use a common approach, shared tools and infrastructure to achieve this recommendation. In response to this recommendation, the Federal Open Science Repository of Canada (FOSRC) was launched in January 2024 to provide a stable shared infrastructure for open sharing of research output produced by participating Government of Canada science-based departments and agencies. Other departments and agencies also have stand-alone repositories for their data and information. More information on the FOSRC and other government depositories can be found in response to question 3.4. Many departments have also entered into transformative agreements with publishers, either individually or collectively via the Federal Science Libraries Network, (a network of seven Government of Canada science-based department and agency libraries) to make open access publishing more accessible to government researchers. Government of Canada departments and agencies have also held training sessions and developed resources for employees on open science, including: • Environment and Climate Change Canada has an intranet site providing resources and training materials to employees to support open science implementation in their research. • Natural Resources Canada has an internal webpage that is dedicated to promoting open science and open access publishing. NRCan has also established a cross- sectoral working group to provide a report and recommendations for open access publishing. • Fisheries and Oceans Canada funds internal research through the Competitive Science Research Fund (CSRF). All projects funded through the CSRF must have a credible data management plan in place, which addresses open data principles. The Department also publishes a plain-language public report annually, along with communication and outreach products so that all Canadians are informed on the state of the Atlantic, Arctic and Pacific Oceans. The report is based on available scientific information, a large portion of which is publicly funded. • The Public Health Agency of Canada publishes two Diamond Open Access peer- reviewed scientific journals, the Canada Communicable Disease Report and Health Promotion and Chronic Disease Prevention in Canada: Research, Policy and Practice. • Health Canada and the Public Heath Agency of Canada both administer departmental Open Access Funds that support researchers and scientists by covering 100% of the charges paid to scientific journals to ensure that federal health publications are open and freely accessible at the time of their publication. • Statistics Canada makes its publications openly available and free of charge on the Statistics Canada website. Access to Statistics Canada research is further enabled through the Statistics Canada Open Licence, royalty-free, non-exclusive licence to its publications, tables, graphs and reports. Government of Canada departments and agencies that fund research carried out by external parties have also made efforts to incorporate open science values. Examples include: • The Canadian Space Agency’s grant and contribution funding programs actively encourage recipients to publish their research findings in alignment with open science Page 9 of 40 principles, including the smartEarth program1 and the Flights and Fieldwork for the Advancement of Science and Technology (FAST 2021)2 program. • Fisheries and Oceans Canada provides funding to external science organizations through transfer payment programs. Funding recipients are required to report on data dissemination and how the results were made available to the public. • The Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) (collectively known as the agencies or Tri-Agency) are federal research granting agencies that have developed policies that aim to make the research they fund as open as possible. Specifically, the Tri-Agency Open Access Policy on Publications (2015) aims to improve access to research funded by those agencies by outlining open access expectations for grant recipients. All peer- reviewed journal publications from Agency-supported research are expected to be freely accessible within 12 months of publication. The agencies have also recently announced a revision of the 2015 Policy that aims to make agency-supported research freely available at the time of publication. The agencies are engaging with a wide range of partners within the research community to identify and aim to align with national and international funders. A draft of the policy will be released for feedback in the first half of 2025, while the final policy will be released by the end of 2025. • The Tri-Agency Research Data Management Policy outlines expectations for research institutions and grant recipients on how research data will be managed and shared. The implementation of the policy requirements will support the core values and guiding principles of open science, including quality and integrity, collective benefit, transparency, scrutiny, critique and reproducibility, and collaboration, participation, and inclusion: o In 2025, the agencies will expand pilot projects that require grant applicants to develop and submit Data Management Plans (DMPs) with application materials. The DMP requirement encourages applicants to think about openness of research data. o The agencies will also be developing a data deposit requirement, following extensive consultations. Although the data deposit requirement is not an open data requirement, it confirms the agencies’ expectations that researchers should provide appropriate access to the data where ethical, cultural, legal and commercial requirements allow, and in accordance with the FAIR principles and the standards of their disciplines. o The policy also emphasizes the importance of Indigenous data sovereignty and research data management principles that recognize and respect self-determination for First Nations, Inuit, and Métis Peoples through a distinctions-based approach. The policy has several requirements of researchers engaged with Indigenous 1 smartEarth is a funding initiative aimed at developing Earth observation applications.

Page 10 of 40 research to discourage the unfair and inequitable extraction of data and knowledge. The agencies will continue to engage with Indigenous partners in 2025 to support Indigenous data sovereignty. The Quebec (provincial) government has implemented specific measures to ensure that publicly funded research reflects the values and principles of open science, notably through the Fonds de recherche du Québec (FRQ) Common General Rules, which were updated in 2024. In addition, the FRQ adopted a revised version of its Open Access Dissemination Policy in 2022 (initial policy 2019) to strengthen its support for open science and sharing of scientific findings. The FRQ has a requirement to immediately provide open access under an open licence for the work it funds, the findings of which are published in scholarly journals. The FRQ has also set up two programs for fiscal year 2025–2026, a program to support French scientific journals (in French only) and a program to support the creation of two French scientific journals in health, science and engineering (in French only) to help provide immediate open access and support the implementation of the Diamond model and open licences. Finally, the FRQ funds the Réseau québécois de recherche et de mutualisation pour les revues scientifiques (2024–2025) (in French only), which aims to support the transition to the Diamond model throughout the Quebec publishing ecosystem. The Québec provincial government also provides guidance to support knowledge transfer in certain sectors (Guide to support the implementation of promising practices in an institution (in French only); Reference framework for knowledge transfer infrastructures in the health and social services network (in French only); Guide to implementing supporting infrastructure for knowledge implementation and transfer (in French only)

## B2 – Open Science Policies and Governance

### B2.3 — Please provide details and links as relevant, including for each instrument: Title of the instrument, its objective, the authority in charge, allocated budget, elements of open science included

There are many policy instruments, programs, strategies or internal mechanisms in Canada that promote open science. Federal government examples are described under questions 1.4, 2.2, 2.5, 2.6 and 3.4. In addition, some of the Quebec (provincial) government’s strategic plans and sector action plans support open science by including measures to develop or enhance knowledge and make it available by disseminating new datasets, such as the SIGÉOM (Système d’information géominière) (in French only). Another example is the Policy Framework for Managing Information Assets (in French only), which lays the foundation for structured and strategic data management within the Autorité des marchés financiers (Quebec’s financial market regulatory body). This policy establishes the roles and responsibilities of the Head of Data and Advanced Analytics, who is responsible for setting up data governance and development structures to encourage a data-driven organizational culture. There is also a data development management framework, which was updated in 2024 and aims to maximize the use of data to support decision making; ensure the quality, accessibility and protection of data; and promote the ethical and harmonized use of data across different entities while balancing the benefits and risks of data development.

### B2.4 — Please provide details and links as relevant, including the name of ministries and national authorities/entities, as well as affiliated organizations that are involved in the development and implementation of the plan, strategy or the roadmap

The 2020 Roadmap for Open Science, developed by the Office of the Chief Science Advisor of Canada, is intended to guide open science activities in Canada. Details on the Roadmap and related action plans are described under question 2.2. In addition, the main objective of the Fonds de recherche du Québec’s Open Access Dissemination Policy, adopted in 2019 and revised in 2022, is to promote open access to peer-reviewed publications and to ensure that they are disseminated quickly and available for free (for readers) to the scientific community, potential users, policy-makers and the general public.

### B2.5 — Please provide more information, including the number of policies, name of the institute(s) that has/have developed the policy(s) and elements of open science included in the policy (please consider policies and strategies addressing all elements of open science, including citizen
and participatory  science, or co-production of knowledge with multiple actors).

Federal government science-based departments and agencies developed open science action plans in response to the 2020 federal Roadmap for Open Science; departmental scientific integrity policies also serve to promote open science. More detail can be found under question 2.2. The Quebec (provincial) government has implemented several initiatives that are aligned with the elements of open science at the institutional level, as highlighted in the version of the Fonds de recherche du Québec’s Open Access Dissemination Policy revised in 2022. In 2020, Quebec joined the Open Government Partnership (in French only), an international initiative that encourages departments and agencies to be more transparent and to adopt practices aligned with the principles of open science.. Between 2019 and 2023, the Quebec Government Digital Transformation Strategy (in French only) focused on reusing and developing data to support economic development and create new value-added digital services in various sectors. The Government Cybersecurity and Digital Strategy, 2024–2028 (in French only), states that public organizations be provided with government guidance on how to access open data. Other initiatives include the 2024–2025 funding program for a Quebec network of scientific journals (Réseau québécois de recherche et de mutualisation pour les revues scientifiques, in French only), Fonds de recherche du Québec’s Open Access Dissemination Policy, adopted in 2019 and revised in 2022, which covers the open access dissemination of works published in scholarly journals and master’s and doctoral theses. As well, initiatives by other organizations within the Quebec government promote the implementation of open science. Of note is the Quebec Department of Natural Resources and Forests’ Data Dissemination Policy (in French only), which provides for the free and open re-use of data from the Department under aCreative Commons licence. This policy supports Quebec’s commitment to open government, which aims to promote transparency and free access to data. Page 15 of 40 The Université de Montréal has the first UNESCO Chair on Open Science and an associated advisory group on the creation and dissemination of scientific information in French. The Tanenbaum Open Science Institute (TOSI), part of the Neuro (Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital) at McGill University, was founded to drive the adoption of Open Science across Canadian neuroscience research institutes. TOSI supports and guides other institutes in adopting Open Science practices and principles and established an alliance of neuroscience research institutes across Canada committed to Open Science. The UNESCO Chair in Community Based Research and Social Responsibility in Higher Education based at the University of Victoria and the Society of Participatory Research in Asia (PRIA) supports North–South–South and South–South partnerships that build on and enhance the emerging consensus in knowledge democracy. The UNESCO Chair had an important role in CCUNESCO’s outputs on Open Science and decolonization of knowledge in higher education, including a global webinar series (see section 1.3).

### B2.6 — Please provide details and links as relevant

Examples of funding mechanisms available in Canada are provided here and in response to question 2.7. As well, some of the repositories described in section 3.4 are intended to support open access and replace the need for specific funding mechanisms. As federal examples, Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada both administer departmental Open Access Funds that support researchers and scientists by covering 100% of the charges paid to scientific journals to ensure that federal health publications are open and freely accessible at the time of their publication. Examples at the provincial level: In 2021, the Fonds de recherche du Québec within the Quebec (provincial) government joined cOAlition S, an international group promoting the open dissemination of scientific findings. At the sector level, the Quebec (provincial) government funds projects led by universities and colleges that involve open science technologies, allowing knowledge to be acquired and shared within a collaborative framework. The Partnership for Open Access (POA), created by Érudit and the Canadian Research Knowledge Network 10 years ago, is driving the growth of open access publishing in Canada. It provides financial support to non-commercial scholarly journals through the ongoing commitment of partner libraries and is based on a close collaboration between all stakeholders in the research ecosystem. The POA is based on an open access model in which no fees are charged to readers and authors, known as Diamond open access, thus building a collective, equitable and strong path for knowledge dissemination. Every year, the POA allows more than 2,000 scholarly articles to be published through Diamond open access. The POA financially supports over 250 non-commercial scholarly journals. More than 160 of these journals publish in immediate open access, including 40 that Page 16 of 40 have made the transition to open access thanks to the POA. The POA is supported by over 90 libraries worldwide

### B2.7 — Please provide details and links as relevant

The (federal) Canadian Space Agency grant and contribution funding programs actively encourage recipients to publish their results in alignment with open science principles. Examples include the Canadian Space Agency’s smartEarth initiative and the Flights and Fieldwork for the Advancement of Science and Technology (FAST 2021) program. smartEarth is the Canadian Space Agency’s revitalized funding initiative aimed at developing Earth observation applications. It promotes the smart use of satellite data to create solutions for critical global challenges. The FAST program supports research projects at Canadian universities and post-secondary institutions that advance scientific knowledge and space technologies, while also providing students with hands-on experience in space-related missions (for further details see Research Opportunities in Satellite Earth Observation | Canadian Space Agency). Fisheries and Oceans Canada funds internal research through the Competitive Science Research Fund (CSRF) which requires projects to have a credible data management plan in place that addresses open data principles. The Genomics Research and Development Initiative (GRDI), which funds genomic research in federal government laboratories in areas such as health care, food safety and global food security, sound management of natural resources, a sustainable and competitive agriculture sector, and environment protection, has projects in eight federal science departments and agencies. The GRDI maximizes access to federally funded scientific research and complies with the federal Open Government Directive. The Tri-Agency Open Access Policy on Publications (2015) is being updated by Canada’s federal research granting agencies, with the goal of requiring that any peer-reviewed journal publications arising from agency-supported research be freely available, without subscription or fee, at the time of publication. The renewed policy will be released by the end of 2025 (see section 1.4). Examples at the provincial level: The Quebec (provincial) government has integrated open science practices into the work it funds. Through its Common General Rules and Open Access Dissemination Policy, the Fonds de recherche du Québec requires that the work it funds be made openly accessible and published under an open licence. In addition, some of its support programs for French- language scientific journals and funding for the Réseau québécois de recherche et de mutualisation pour les revues scientifiques actively support the transition to immediate open access and promote more open scientific dissemination.

### B2.8 — Please provide details and links as relevant

The Quebec (provincial) government has made efforts to foster equitable public-private partnerships on open science. These partnerships vary from sector to sector. For example, the expertise of the Consortium de recherche et d’innovation en transformation métallique was established to implement the Critical and strategic minerals research network ( in French only) of the Quebec Departments of Economy, Innovation and Energy and Natural Resources and Forests. In addition, Quebec set up a research promotion structure for all public research institutions called Axelys. This structure is rooted in the desire to improve the dissemination, mobilization and use of scientific knowledge for the benefit of society. Within this structure, numerous public-private partnerships are set up at the project level to maximize the use of knowledge, while complying with university policies that preserve non-commercial research and teaching rights related to intellectual property resulting from public research

### B2.9 — Please provide details and links as relevant

As described previously, the Roadmap for Open Science contains overarching recommendations to guide open science activities in Canada, and for Government of Canada departments and agencies to develop action plans for open science that include a performance measurement element. Canada’s National Action Plan on Open Government also contains commitments and indicators related to open science. Some indicators related to open science from the 2022–2024 National Action Plan are listed below (see National Action Plan on Open Government Tracker for complete list, including others related to open science). • C01.1.1 - Add content and features to the Open Science and Data Platform, using user engagement and feedback, both internal and external to government to set priorities for additions • C01.3.2 - Yearly reports on progress against existing metrics measuring implementation of open science by Science-Based Departments and Agencies, with a focus on open access metrics and diverse types of open access, to be released in the open Page 18 of 40 • C05.2.2 - Establish an internal and external stakeholder open data advisory working group to help inform open data priorities, help inform the establishment of public reporting on open data release progress, identify open data users and experts, and report publicly on the work and deliberations of the working group and impact of open data • C05.2.04 - Consult on and develop service standards for prioritizing and releasing open data and using the portal as part of the open data plan. In addition, the Federal Science Libraries Network has been preparing annual Open Science Dashboards for each member department since 2022, outlining the progress towards open science goals and specific open science indicators. At least one federal government department (Natural Resources Canada) includes an open science annual performance measurement indicator in its departmental results framework.

## B4 – Education, Capacity Building & Science Communication

### B4.1 — Please indicate if those capacity building initiatives are formal or informal and provide more information and links as relevant

Within federal government departments that carry out open science, a variety of training, guides and other resources have been made available to scientific staff. Several examples are described below. • The Federal Science Libraries Network (FSLN) comprising seven Government of Canada science-based departments and agencies, is jointly developing a tool to help FSLN researchers search, browser and select open access journals for publishing that are covered by the FSLN transformative agreements with publishers. • The National Research Council Canada’s library held an author profile clinic during the summer of 2024 to help researchers create and populate their ORCID records. The results and all accompanying materials were shared with other government departments and agencies to facilitate replication of this activity. • The National Research Council Canada’s (NRC) library built a libguide called “Open Science 101 For Researchers” and delivered a presentation on Open Access Publishing at NRC during Canadian Library Month. • Environment and Climate Change Canada’s Library Services offer scientists and researchers resources and training to facilitate open access of publicly funded research, publications and data. • The Public Health Agency of Canada has provided training and support to its researchers and authors to support the use of ORCID persistent identifiers in publication, to identify and select Open Access journals, and to contribute their work to the Federal Open Science Repository of Canada. The PHAC Library has also developed reference guides on Open Access publishing, ORCID usage, and mechanisms to offset Open Access publishing costs, including Transformative Agreements. • Fisheries and Oceans Canada has developed a guide for employees on how to publish articles in open access journals and on how to create and maintain ORCID IDs. In addition, the Department’s scientific staff have received training in plain language communication. In the Quebec (provincial) government, training on the obligations arising from the Fonds de Recherche du Québec (FRQ)’s Open Access Dissemination Policy has been systematically offered to FRQ employees since 2022 and to new grant holders since 2023. Also, the FRQ webpage for the version of the Open Access Dissemination Policy revised in 2022 (in French only) contains frequently asked questions, videos and other resources on open access publishing. The Quebec University Library Partnership’s (Partenariat des bibliothèques universitaires du Québec, in French only) mission is to “equip Quebec universities with innovative information management platforms.” Its priority area 3 “Open science and support for research activities” includes the implementation of a shared service offering to support scholarly journals. Page 24 of 40 The Érudit organization (see section 3.4, Appendix 2) organizes numerous knowledge mobilization activities for its user communities, journal editorial teams and researchers who publish in its journals to help them understand and adopt open access and open science best practices. The Érudit team organized three recent events on these issues: a two-day conference entitled “Perspectives sur la publication et les revues savants : évolution du libre accès, des pratiques d’évaluation et des nouvelles possibilités de recherche” (Perspectives on publishing and scholarly journals: evolution of open access, evaluation practices, and new opportunities for research) held as part of the 2023 annual Acfas4 Conference (May 11 and 12, 2023, Université de Montréal); and two symposia for the editorial teams (one for scholarly journals based in Quebec and the other for those based across Canada). Érudit also published a research note on open science (2021, in French only). The Tanenbaum Open Science Institute (TOSI) provides support and informational materials on open science to neurological researchers through its annual Neuro Open Science in Action Symposium and the open science educational resources on its website. The Open Climate Campaign led by Creative Commons, SPARC (Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition) and EIFL (Electronic Information for Libraries) provided several workshops and webinars to researchers on open science practices. The Campaign ended in 2024

### B4.2 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

A federal interdepartmental working group dedicated to developing and implementing open science practices within the Government of Canada has been established, chaired by Environment and Climate Change Canada.. Participants meet bimonthly to share lessons learned, best practices and challenges in implementing open science. As well, some federal departments and agencies have created internal open science networks or working groups. For example, the Public Health Agency of Canada has launched an internal Open Science Community of Practice to enhance awareness of open science practices and supports for researchers, science communicators and policy-makers. Environment and Climate Change Canada has a working group that aims to implement open science across the Department. In Quebec, a variety of measures have been implemented to develop decision makers’ capacity in both open science and science in general. For example, the Chief Scientist of Québec advises the Quebec (provincial) government on the state of science in relation to a wide range of societal issues. The Office of the Chief Scientist raises the profile of Quebec research in Canada and around the world and promotes careers in research and scientific culture. In 2024, the Quebec government also announced the creation of a table of municipal chief science advisors (in French only) that would be a forum for discussion and collaboration 4 Acfas was previously known as the Association canadienne-française pour l’avancement des sciences (1923-2001) and Association francophone pour le savoir (2001-2019). Page 25 of 40 to establish a consistent approach to the practice of municipal scientific advice across Quebec. Quebec has also set up innovation zones. They are designed to attract researchers from Quebec and elsewhere to collaborate on innovation projects in promising technological sectors in which Quebec has significant comparative advantages. These researchers work in close collaboration with municipalities, research and teaching institutions, economic organizations and businesses. Scientific knowledge generation is one of the societal benefits of these innovation zones. The Érudit organization actively works to inform decision makers at various levels of the principles and values of open science, including within the consortium’s universities, libraries and research-funding agencies. To do so, Érudit produces numerous notes and reports for decision makers and organizes events, such as the panel “Towards the adoption of diverse approaches to open access: Promoting the dissemination and use of knowledge across disciplines” held during the 2023 Canadian Science Policy Conference.

Government of Canada (federal) departments and agencies share and promote the results of their scientific research to decision makers and the public at large. Federal science is publicly funded science, and driven by the mandate of each department, for the benefit of Canadians. As well, many federal departments make publications openly available in government repositories (section 3.4), such as the Federal Open Science Repository of Canada (FOSRC), with the FOSRC in the process of implementing plain language summaries to help research reach a broader audience. Federal departments and agencies contribute research data to Canada’s Open Government Portal. Other examples of federal government efforts to disseminate scientific knowledge are listed below: • Environment and Climate Change Canada posts links to published research regularly on social media (X, LinkedIn, Facebook); the department also has various programs aimed at communicating science such as: o Ask a Scientist: a video series promoting ECCC’s science where Canadians can ask questions to scientists o Science in Action: a video series showcasing ECCC’s scientists in the field o Scientist-at-large: an initiative that connects ECCC scientists with the public through speaking engagement activities to communicate ECCC science in a more meaningful way • The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) shares and publishes scientific information across many channels, including on inspection.canada.ca, on social media, through statements and news releases, on the Cultivating Science blog, and through media interviews. Additionally, scientific reports on food safety are currently available on the CFIA website. • Parks Canada’s science communication initiatives include national reports (e.g., Parks Canada Carbon Atlas Series – Carbon Dynamics in the Forests of National Parks in Canada), #ParksCanadaConservation communication products via social media (X, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube) and Parks Canada’s website, as well as a variety of interpretation programs and products offered at National Parks, National Historic Sites, National Marine Conservation Areas and the National Urban Park administered by Parks Canada. • The Health Canada and Public Health Agency of Canada Scientific Integrity Policy gives researchers and scientists the right, and encourages them, to speak about or otherwise express themselves on science and their research without approval or pre-approval. To this end, Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada developed the Science and Research Communications Handbook. • The Public Health Agency of Canada and Health Canada jointly publish a blog series (The Science of Health) to share information with the public on their scientific activities and achievements in plain language. • To highlight the importance of social and behavioural sciences in public health, the Public Health Agency of Canada provides public information on its Behavioural Science program and products. • Fisheries and Oceans Canada publishes scientific advice resulting from its formal peer review process online (Publications), increasingly with links to supporting data. In this way, Page 27 of 40 DFO is making government science available to the public by providing information on the scope of the science advice, its intent, the data inputs, and the participants involved in the peer-review. • Natural Resources Canada publishes scientific briefs and links to scientific information via social media channels, including through its Simply Science products. • Statistics Canada has several publications to disseminate scientific knowledge to researchers of different disciplines, decision makers and the public at large including: Health Reports, Economic and Social Reports, Juristat and Survey Methodology. In addition, all new data and products are communicated to Canadians through The Daily and the StatsCAN mobile application. • Grant applications submitted to the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada must include a knowledge mobilization description that identifies key audiences and how they will be reached. In partnership with UNESCO, the Canadian Commission for UNESCO published An introduction to the UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science in March 2023. CCUNESCO shared the open source files of this brochure with other National Commissions, encouraging them to republish it in their respective languages. Dissemination of the brochure and CCUNESCO’s work to ensure the inclusion of Indigenous perspectives in Open Science dialogues has taken shape in webinars, podcasts, and in-person events, for example, the University of Toronto’s Knowledge Equity Lab podcast, Perspectives on the UNESCO Open Science Recommendation. In Quebec, the Fonds de recherche du Québec (FRQ) aims to make access to scientific knowledge more equitable and to contribute to citizen scientific literacy (Science ouverte [in French only]). The FRQ organizes events on the dissemination of scientific knowledge, such as the panel entitled Support strategies for the transition to open access during the Canadian Science Policy Centre (CSPC) conference in November 2024. The FRQ also organized a session entitled Relever le défi de la diffusion en libre accès des publications scientifiques (Rising to the challenge of open access dissemination of scientific publications) held during the 91st Acfas Conference in May 2024. The overall theme of the conference—Mobiliser les savoirs en français (Knowledge mobilization in French)—reflects an effort to share research results with the broader community. The Quebec (provincial) government publishes certain data for the general public in the form of a directory, such as the directory of innovative wood construction projects (Répertoire de projets de construction innovants en bois, in French only). In collaboration with the university network, the Quebec government organizes free virtual meetings open to all for the transfer of scientific knowledge, such as the Forest knowledge rendezvous (in French only). These meetings provide a forum for exchanging and sharing expertise. Sector-specific conferences, such as the annual Québec Mines + Energy Conference (Appendix 3) organized by the Quebec (provincial) government also provide an opportunity to foster knowledge exchange and knowledge mobilization

## B5 – Research Assessment and Incentives

### B5.1 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

Federal science-based departments and agencies are increasingly moving toward recognizing and incentivizing open science values and principles in career progression frameworks for their research scientists. See also Section 2.7 which provides information on how open science is considered in research application processes and most of that information would be relevant to this section. Through the Quebec (provincial) government , the Fonds de recherche du Québec became a member of the Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment (COARA) and plans to review its assessment processes in the near future.

### B5.2 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

Federal science-based departments and agencies are increasingly moving toward recognizing and incentivizing open science values and principles in career progression frameworks for their research scientists. Within the Government of Canada, career progression for federal research scientists is guided by a Career Progression Management Framework for Federal Researchers (2006). The Framework identifies “collaborative research and development projects and public outreach” among the list of productivity outputs expected of researchers for their career advancement. Specific departments may provide further guidance, recognition and incentives related to open science. For example, at Natural Resources Canada, scientists involved in open science activities can submit relevant evidence when presenting their dossiers for evaluation and career advancement. Page 29 of 40 The Public Health Agency of Canada, with input from other science-based departments and agencies in the Government of Canada, is currently undertaking a review of the criteria for promotion outlined in the Career Progression Management Framework for Federal Researchers, in order to incorporate updated priorities and guiding principles, including open science. Any revisions are not expected to be fully implemented until at least 2026-27, to allow researchers, managers, and review committees time to become familiar with the interpretation and application of any criteria, including open science practices. Within the Quebec (provincial) government, the Fonds de recherche du Québec has standardized its scientific reporting templates to include requirements for information gathering, open access and open licences under its Open Access Dissemination Policy. In addition, the Fonds de recherche du Québec has adapted its open access publication requirements to the specifics of funding large research groups, which sometimes include hundreds of researchers under the same funding, to allow a gradual transition to immediate open access

### B5.3 — For each initiative, please provide more information, including on the stakeholders[i] that are involved or lead the initiative, and links as relevant.

The Tanenbaum Open Science Institute (TOSI) offers Open Science awards and prizes for researchers to promote change in the way scientists are evaluated. The awards focus on qualitative impact rather than the number of publications.

### B5.4 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

It is not clear if negative trends in scientific publishing, including an increase in predatory publishers and high article processing charges, can be attributed to open science practices. There have been efforts within the federal government science community to mitigate these trends, such as the distribution of information on predatory publishing to scientific staff and through negotiating agreements with publishers to reduce or eliminate article processing charges. The federal science community is also concerned with the potential negative consequences of open science/open data practices in the context of Reconciliation and the assertion of Ownership, Control, Access and Possession (OCAP) principles by Indigenous communities. As more datasets become widely available, ones that have restrictions on use may be less Page 30 of 40 likely to be used, particularly with the rise of AI. This may further marginalize perspectives of Indigenous communities. The Quebec (provincial) government has identified a funding issue in the publication of research findings in scholarly journals with immediate open access. Scholarly journals sometimes charge publication fees, and fees are sometimes required for Diamond open access journals to operate consistently. Another obstacle is the lack of recognition for open access publishing practices in the standards used to evaluate researchers’ scientific output. This prevents the scientific community from adopting this practice. It is also difficult to counter the appeal of publishing in prestigious scholarly journals which do not publish in immediate open access. There can be perceived conflict between the principle of open science and the need to make knowledge accessible for different audiences. This is in line with the open science values of access and benefits-sharing for society, but misunderstandings sometimes persist among certain scientific or societal stakeholders. Finally, a lack of positive regional benefits for locally funded or supported science presents a challenge. The free and automatic dissemination of knowledge does not necessarily guarantee that it will be used for the benefit of the community that generated it. This underlines the importance of having stakeholders who are dedicated to mobilizing scientific knowledge in order to encourage its adoption and use. Although this issue does not conflict with the principles of open science, it is recurring, and mechanisms for sharing the societal benefits of scientific output must be developed

## B6 – Engagement of Societal Actors & Open Innovation

### B6.1 — Indicate which of the recommended actions they address

▪ promotion of pre-prints Several repositories described in section 3.4 include or have been set up to include pre-prints, such as the Federal Open Science Repository of Canada (FOSRC) and Natural Resources Canada’s Open Science and Technology Repository. Page 31 of 40 ▪ exploration of open peer-reviewed practices ▪ valuing and sharing of negative scientific results and associated data ▪ participatory methods that value inputs from societal actors, e.g., citizen science, crowdsourcing scientific projects Results from CCUNESCO’s nine-part global webinar series Open Science and the Decolonization of Knowledge encouraged the 2021 Recommendation to include participatory and intersectoral science elements to ensure that Indigenous knowledge and perspectives would be included respectfully and with integrity in science activities. Canada’s Citizen Science Portal is a compilation of citizen science projects across the country. Projects are led by a variety of organizations, including universities, non-government organizations and government departments. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency has established collaborations with Indigenous communities in Canada. These efforts embody Inclusive Science by respecting Indigenous Knowledge systems and including them in scientific research processes. Such collaborations ensure that diverse perspectives are integrated into the design, execution, and dissemination stages of research, fostering mutual learning and co-creation of knowledge. The Public Health Agency of Canada has successfully implemented participatory/citizen science methods for disease and vector surveillance via FluWatchers and the Tiger Mosquito Citizen Science Study. Health Canada included a commitment in Canada’s fifth National Action Plan on Open Government 2022–2024 to support the development of necessary infrastructure, including guidance, capacity building, and information technology, to better enable citizen science more effectively in a health context. To deliver in part on this commitment, Health Canada provides interdepartmental coordination on participatory research and citizen science to benchmark researchers’ needs, inform infrastructure requirements and develop guidelines and standards to ensure safe, secure, and responsible collection, management and analysis of participant data and contributions. Health Canada undertook public opinion research in 2023, to better understand the public’s interest, motivators and barriers to participating in government-led research. With a focus on traditionally underrepresented demographics of the population, including low-income and rural communities, visible minorities, and Indigenous peoples in Canada, this work is informing efforts to develop guidance for researchers seeking to recruit and retain volunteers in federal citizen science research. In its response to the 2023 study by the Standing Committee on Science and Research on the role and value of citizen scientists in Canada, Health Canada has committed to exploring how to streamline processes, simplify public access, and increase the ease of use of the results in government projects across the federal science environment. For example, Health Canada’s partnership with Laboratories Canada is exploring enterprise-wide digital solutions and enablement, and support for reducing barriers to science collaboration in the federal science environment. Health Canada is also working with Shared Services Canada’s Science Program to develop a prototype (proof of concept) participatory research exchange platform which would meet Government of Canada standards for accessibility, official languages and security. Participatory research/citizen science is also reflected in Health Canada’s Framework for Science and Research Excellence, under “Innovation and Real-World Learning” underscoring the Page 32 of 40 importance of citizen science as a key element of the department’s toolkit to strengthen Health Canada science and support representative and timely decision making. The accessibility of science, expressed in terms of knowledge transfer, is now evaluated by all Quebec (provincial) government research-funding agencies. The current trend is to take it one step further with specific programs for knowledge co-creation; action research; partnership research, discussions on commercializing research prior to scientific output; and research focused on addressing major societal challenges. The Fonds de recherche du Québec also funds a number of participatory research programs involving citizen science including ENGAGE - 2025–2026 (in French only). ▪ development of participatory strategies for identifying the needs of marginalized communities and highlighting socially relevant issues to be incorporated into research agendas Some Quebec (provincial) government calls for proposals, such as Concerted action: Cultural safety, experience and needs of First Nations and Inuit users of the health and social services network, (in French only) aim for the knowledge generated by the funded project to improve our understanding of First Nations and Inuit people’s use of, and experience with, health care and social services, and to generate discussion to support decision making on cultural safety in health and social services establishments. ▪ promoting open innovation practices ▪ other: open access publishing by default Several members of the Federal Science Libraries Network opted for “Open Access by default” in their transformative agreement with the publisher Springer. Open Access by default ensures that all affiliated articles are open and accessible at the time of their publication. ▪ other: providing funding support Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada’s Open Access Funds support researchers and scientists by covering 100% of the charges paid to scientific journals, to ensure that publications funded by these departments in the federal health portfolio are open and freely accessible at the time of their publication. ▪ other: new approaches to research assessment The federal research granting bodies (The Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada) within the Government of Canada signed the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA), a Declaration that recognizes the need to improve the ways in which the outputs of scholarly research are evaluated. DORA signatories include more than 60 other Canadian universities and research institutions. ▪ other: approaches to data management Tri-Agency research data management policy is in line with FAIR and CARE principles. The agencies are involved in ongoing engagements with institutions, organizations and partners to support Indigenous research data management principles. The Data Management Policy for the Tri-Agencies within the Government of Canada encourages applicants to include data management plans with funding applications in order to encourage data openness and the sharing of research results. ▪ other: creation of knowledge-mobilization organizations. Page 33 of 40 In Quebec, the creation of Axelys (see sections 2.8 and 3.4) is expected to allow a greater number and diversity of stakeholders to benefit from the positive societal impacts of scientific knowledge generation

## B7 – International Cooperation

### B7.1 — How is your country promoting and facilitating international scientific collaborations on open science as outlined in the 2021 Recommendation on Open Science?

Canadian federal government departments and agencies are members of many international research organizations that support open science. Some examples are provided below: Since 2017, the Canadian Space Agency has partnered with NASA to provide Canadian data, training resources, and the support of experts and judges for the International Space Apps Challenge, the world’s largest annual global hackathon. It aims to encourage participants to solve real-world challenges using open data from and/or about space. This partnership has continued ever since, engaging participants from across the country. In 2020, NASA, in coordination with the U.S. Department of State and seven other initial signatory nations, established the Artemis Accords. The Canadian Space Agency signed the Artemis Accords on behalf of Canada in October 2020. These Accords reinforce the signatories’ commitment to key international agreements, including the Outer Space Treaty, the Registration Convention, and the Rescue and Return Agreement, while promoting best practices and responsible behaviour in civil space exploration. Signatories of the Artemis Accords also pledge to openly share scientific data and publicly release research results, ensuring that people worldwide can benefit from the progress made in space exploration and discovery. Canada supports the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (Ocean Decade) and Fisheries and Oceans Canada works with the Canadian ocean community, such as the Oceans Research in Canada Alliance (ORCA), to advance ocean science efforts. Fisheries and Oceans Canada engages in several other international initiatives that advance open science, including the North Pacific Marine Science Organization and the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). ICES is an international marine science organization that develops impartial evidence on the state and sustainable use of our seas and oceans. It developed a Transparent Assessment Framework (TAF), an open data resource that aims to make data, methods and results from ICES assessments transparent, easy to find, explore and re-run. The Quebec (provincial) government has also developed international collaborations on open science. The Fonds de recherche du Québec is a member of cOAlition S, an international consortium of granting agencies that supports immediate open access to scientific publications and implements Plan S. The UNESCO Chair on Open Science at the Université de Montréal, Professor Vincent Larivière works with 17 partners from 10 countries to advance understanding of Open Science in its various forms, and its impact on the dissemination of scientific knowledge nationally and internationally

### B7.2 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

Canada is an active member of the G7 Open Science Working Group, which was established in 2016 during the G7 Ministers of Science and Technology meeting in Tsukuba, Japan. It aims to share open science policies, explore supportive incentive structures, and identify good practices for promoting increasing access to the results of publicly funded research, including scientific data and publications5. Please see section 7.1 for other examples of existing collaboration.

### B7.3 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so.

We are not aware of Canada’s involvement in any regional (multi-country) or international funding mechanisms for open science. Regional examples of funding mechanisms within Canada are provided in other sections of this document.

## B8 – Other

### B8.1 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

Institutions in Canada are facing funding challenges to support the development and maintenance of open science practices, such as open access repositories, data-sharing platforms, and training programs. Ensuring compliance with privacy laws and safeguarding sensitive data, for example in the fields of food safety and Indigenous research, creates additional layers of complexity in implementing open science principles. Another key challenge is finding a balance between openness and the protection of proprietary research and intellectual property, particularly in collaborations with private industry or sensitive government work. For example, in Quebec much of the Autorité des marchés financiers’ data are stored in systems co-owned with other members of the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA). Access to and use of this data is governed by an intellectual property and licensing agreement for the CSA’s national systems that includes controls and restrictions that the various members must comply with. There are also limitations on the open access dissemination of knowledge due to national security requirements, which are playing an increasingly larger role in the Canadian scientific landscape. Another barrier to full participation in open science is the commercial nature of scientific publishing. While Diamond Open Access venues are available, individual researchers are motivated by prestige and impact associated with scientific journals published by for-profit corporations. Institutions that support open access publication, via payment of article processing charges or transformational subscription agreements, are nevertheless contributing to a publishing model that is not motivated by the principle of knowledge as a common good, and participation in science as an inherent right. New strategies put in place by for-profit journals to counter the anticipated loss of revenue from the increase in immediate open access and open licence publishing (e.g., charging fees to publish with Green open access) impedes implementation of the Recommendation.
