In Cuban institutions and universities, the implementation of open science is carried out through various programs, methods, and mechanisms that promote transparency, accessibility, and collaboration in scientific research. This is largely due to the impact of the ELINF project on open access within Cuban Higher Education. http://dspace.uclv.edu.cu/handle/123456789/12241.        For example: 	Creation of digital repositories as part of the MES Institutional Digital Repository Network (Resolution No. 30/2024), Policy for the Institutional Digital Repository Network of the Ministry of Higher Education is attached. 	Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) on Open Education and Science: This course, developed by the ELINF-VLIR project, offers training on topics such as copyright, open educational resources, research data management, and open science evaluation. 	Open Science Policy for the Cuban Sports System: Implemented in 2023, this policy seeks to develop key components of open science, such as open access, research data management, open peer review, and the necessary infrastructure. It also includes funding mechanisms and incentives for its promotion.  http://forumcidc.inder.gob.cu/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/POLITICA-CIENCIA-ABIERTA-INDER-GRIZZLY-MENESES-UCLV.pdf?utm_source=perplexity 	Strategy and Policy for Open Science and Education: Presented as a draft in 2019, it seeks to establish a strategic framework that promotes openness in scientific and educational production in the institutions of the Ministry of Higher Education. It includes guidelines for the creation of digital repositories and the implementation of open science practices. https://www.congresouniversidad.cu/event/i-taller-internacional-sobre-ciencia-abierta-en-la-educacion-superior-ca-82/track/recomendacion-de-educacion-y-ciencia-abierta-para-las-universidades-cubanas-5127?utm_source=perplexity  Within the strategic planning of the MES, indicators that contribute to open science have been incorporated, to be measured in all universities. For example: 	Massive open online courses (MOOC) available in Virtual Teaching Learning Environments (EVEA). 	Training actions for teachers in setting up courses in virtual environments. 	Actions carried out for the development of digital skills in students, teachers, researchers and non-teaching staff 	Institutional Digital Repositories registered in OpenDOAR  Scientific associations have also conducted actions related to practices, values and benefits of open science: 	Cuban Society of Information Sciences    This platform aims to manage different documentary collections belonging to scientific fields, research associations or scientific societies and make them available to national and international users through the official SOCICT website and through social networks on the Internet. http://socictopen.socict.org/ 	Cuban Society of Law and Informatics    In the adoption of the National Policy for Digital Transformation and the Cuban Digital Agenda, as well as the Strategy for the development and use of Artificial Intelligence. It addresses areas of interest for the adoption of open science, including: inclusive and participatory digital society, secure and quality connectivity, responsible and secure use of cyberspace, reference frameworks and architectures (conceptual, organizational, data, semantic, etc.) and governance model, the implementation of disruptive technologies such as the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, Big Data and others.

## B7 – International Cooperation

### B7.1 — How is your country promoting and facilitating international scientific collaborations on open science as outlined in the 2021 Recommendation on Open Science?

Government participation in regional, subregional and international initiatives: The Latin American Open Science Forum 2024 from September 11-13. The event served to reinforce the commitment to link science to the needs of people and the planet, and to its constant struggle for access to the benefits of scientific progress for all humanity.    Caracas Declaration: regional launch of the UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science from Latin America and the Caribbean. It was agreed to consider knowledge as “a human right and duty and, therefore, a common good of the peoples that must be at the service of the needs of humanity”, so they agreed to promote more exchanges in the region. And the establishment of alliances between scientific actors and communities, which allow the generation of appropriable knowledge for the transformation of capacities in the region.” https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf000038474              Diamond Global Summits on Open Access. Led by Redalyc in Mexico in 2023 and in Cape    Town in 2024. https://globaldiamantoa.org/. https://doasummit.uct.ac.za/ Cooperation Agreements: Cuba has established bilateral and multilateral agreements with other countries and institutions, promoting the exchange of knowledge, resources and experiences in the field of open science. Participation in International Collaborative Networks: The country and its scientific institutions have joined international networks and platforms that promote open science, allowing Cuban researchers to access information, projects and global collaborations. Joint Projects: Joint research projects have been developed with foreign institutions, where data, methodologies and results are shared, facilitating a collaborative approach to research. National Cuba-AmeliCA Collaboration Program for the creation of the National Repository of Journals Scientific collaboration in health, including bilateral and multilateral projects, such as that between the Center for Molecular Immunology in Cuba and the Roswell Park Institute in Buffalo, New York, for research in biotechnology against cancer. Internationally funded project (VLIR- Belgium): Development of a research data management strategy in Higher Education and Research Institutes in a Latin American context (2022-2024) Internationally funded project (VLIR- Belgium): (Open) education in research data management to accelerate open and responsible science policy and implementation in Higher Education Institutions (2025-2026) International Events: Cuba organizes and participates in international conferences, symposia and workshops that address open science issues, allowing for the exchange of ideas and the creation of links between scientists from different countries. Open Access: The incipient developments of institutional policies encourage publication in open access journals, which makes it easier for the results of Cuban research to be accessible to a global audience.

## B8 – Other

### B8.1 — Please provide more information and links as relevant

United States Government Economic Blockade: This is considered the main obstacle to scientific development in Cuba. A product of this unjust policy: 	Scientific researchers, academics and the Cuban population in general cannot access certain sites and services that facilitate collaboration, exchange and training that include open science topics. In addition, they cannot access specialized platforms for videoconferencing that facilitate exchange, training and collaboration (Zoom). 	Cuban platforms are unable to use the DOI, one of the most widely used persistent identifiers of digital objects in open science infrastructures, which affects their interoperability. They are also unable to use computer programs that, despite being distributed under open licenses, are restricted for download and use in our country. 	Cuba's access to international scientific and academic cooperation and the effective participation of researchers in events, organizations and networks that allow the exchange of information, knowledge and good scientific practices are hindered. 	Access to international funding, technologies, and resources necessary for research is hampered. This not only limits the capabilities of Cuban researchers, but also affects institutions in other countries, especially in the United States. 	The acquisition of scientific technology, both generic and specific, is becoming more difficult, and the obsolescence of the available infrastructure is becoming more acute. 	Access to international databases, publications and specialized sites is limited, affecting the ability of Cuban researchers to stay up to date with global advances in their fields.

### B9 — Any other comments

Despite the mentioned progresses in areas related to the promotion of a common understanding of open science, scientific communication, national research and education networks and infrastructures for open science; Cuba do not have a plan, a strategy, a policy or a national roadmap for the effective adoption of practices for open science. The system policy on science, technology and innovation updated at the end of 2024, will serve as the framework for the development of the national science, technology, and innovation law that will improve the implementation of the Recommendation on Open Science.
