## B2: Open Science Policies & Governance

### B2.1: National STI policy with open science elements
for Slovakia sent 17/03/2025

### B2.2: National policies/legal frameworks aligned with Recommendation
the same as from 23 to 25 question

### B2.3: Specific policy instruments promoting open science
The Contact Office of Open Access was established at the Slovak Centre of Scientific and Technical Information (the SCSTI) in 2016. It plays a key role as a national coordinator and methodological body for open science in Slovakia. One of the activities of the office is to raise awareness about open access and open science and fulfil the tasks arising from international projects in which the SCSTI participates. The office actively participates in fulfilling the tasks of the National Strategy for Open Science for 2021-2028 and the Action Plan to the National Strategy (updated every 2 years) and supports collaboration between individual stakeholders of open science and open access publishing in Slovakia.  Every year, the Contact Office for Open Access organizes professional events, webinars, accredited training and courses to support open science, and provides consultation services.

### B2.4: National implementation plan / roadmap
The Action Plan for Open Science 2024 in Slovakia represents the second phase in implementing the National Strategy for Open Science 2021–2028. Approved by the Slovak Government in February 2024, this plan aims to further integrate open science principles into the country's research and development sectors, aligning with the long-term priorities outlined in the UNESCO Recommendations.

### B2.6: National funding mechanisms for open science
Currently there are three long-term transformative agreements with three publishers (Elsevier, IEEE, SpringerNature) covering gold open access publishing with these publishers.

### B2.7: Open science integrated into research funding
Difficult and fragmented organizational structure of grant agencies, where each organization has a different system and different priorities.

### B2.8: Public-private partnerships for open science
openness, transparency, and inclusivity, contributing meaningfully to the development of a

### B2.9: National monitoring framework for open science
Monitoring of open access publication is under development, links are not available yet

## B3: Infrastructure

### B3.1: R&D expenditure as % of GDP
In 2022, Slovakia's expenditure on research and development (R&D) was approximately 0.84% of its GDP. https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/w/ddn-20231201-2

### B3.2: Population with access to reliable internet
information was reported by the National Institute of Statistics (INS) in December 2024.

### B3.3: National Research and Education Network (NREN)
Slovakia has an active National Research and Education Network (NREN) known as SANET (Slovak Academic Network).  It is a member of the GÉANT network,  connects universities, research institutions, and other educational institutions.

### B3.4: Open science infrastructure (repositories, HPC, cloud)
Slovak Centre of Scientific and Technical Information (CVTI SR) serves as the national information center ensuring the operation of interdisciplinary R&D centers: https://www.vedatechnika.sk/sk/. SCSTI is also a member of EOSC Association.  Slovak Academic Network (SANET) is the national research and education networking organization connecting locations in 23 towns and provides high-speed internet connectivity to universities, research institutions,

### B3.5: Participation in federated international infrastructure
Yes

### B3.6: North-South / South-South infrastructure collaborations
This year we joined the pilot phase of establishing EOSC federation - Slovakia is EOSC node. https://open-science-cloud.ec.europa.eu/. EOSC EU Node is the first European-level node of the emerging EOSC Federation, which is envisioned to be a network of interconnected autonomous nodes, all operating under a common framework of best practices, including open science principles.

## B4: Education, Capacity Building & Science Communication

### B4.1: Systematic capacity building on open science
Currently, there is no systematic education in the field of open science at the higher education level, primarily due to the fragmentation of the system. In Slovakia, this education is addressed through train-the-trainer courses at the level of further education.

### B4.2: Capacity building for policymakers
Capacity building programmes for policy makers are not relevant at the moment, knowledge building is primarily done through the Working Group for Open Science at the Ministry of Education, which includes representatives of government authorities, the academic community, and learning societies.

### B4.3: Open science competencies in higher education curricula
The same as in the question 52.

### B4.5: Science communication initiatives
Slovak Reproducibility Network:  a network of researchers focusing on the implementation of the transparency of research (the philosophy of open science) and the implementation of current methodological and statistical research practices. https://www.slovakrn.org/

## B5: Research Assessment & Incentives

### B5.1: Review of research assessment processes
In Slovakia there is a shift to peer-review evaluation of research publication under development right now.

### B5.4: Challenges and additional observations
High article processing charges associated with gold OA business models in scientific publishing

## B7: International Cooperation

### B7.1: Promoting international scientific collaborations on open science
Yes, Slovakia has established a comprehensive framework to promote cross-border collaboration: participation in the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), partnering with OpenAIRE or Slovak research institutions actively engage in cross-border projects, such as the CAPSID project:

## B8: Other / Additional Comments

### B8.1: Additional observations on open science implementation
Potencial shortage of research funding
