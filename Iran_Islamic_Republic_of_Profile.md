### B3.5 — Please, if possible, briefly explain the reason and the difficulties or obstacles in this area and indicate if there are plans to do so.

Concerning the physical infrastructure, there are few possibilities for researchers in different fields of science and engineering to travel to Europe and Australia and Canada on Sabbatical leaves for sharing and training and conducting shared research projects by using the infrastructure of the universities, RTOs and research organization over there. Because of the American sanctions and their chilling effects, these opportunities are rare with quite uncertainty and could be easily aborted due to political reasons.  The digital infrastructures like open science repositories and open access e-libraries and platforms can be accessed by internet.;Yes
