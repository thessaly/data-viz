### B1.4 — If yes, please indicate the actions that are taken to incorporate the specific values and principles. For each case, please provide details and links as relevant

General actions taken with regard to open access to scholarly publications: •	Funders require immediate open access to publications of results from the research they fund (implemented from 2010 and onwards).  •	Funders contribute to the national system for funding open access publications via direct partial funding of publication at fully open publishers.   •	A majority of the funders do not provide individual researchers with grants to APC:s.  •	Several funders are involved in the discussions on financing a new Open Research Europe (ORE) platform, and have offered support for the work to investigate the possibilities of starting a Nordic Diamond OA competence centre.  •	Funders have been active partners in the work around the open access system of the future and the Swedish guidelines for open science.  General actions taken with regard to open access to research data: In the yearly follow-up of work in Sweden with open access to research data (2024), conducted by the Swedish Research Council, there are funders who have indicated that they do have requirements or incentives for open access to research data (according to the principle “as open as possible, as restricted as necessary”) within some calls for grant applications. (Source: Öppen tillgång till forskningsdata – en kartläggning, analys och bedömning 2024 - Vetenskapsrådet) Specific example: As a funder, the Swedish Research Council have the conditions for receiving a grant- to produce a data management plan, (since 2019) and to comply with the Swedish Research Council’s guidelines for publication with open access. The requirement regarding open access applies to all types of scientific publications, for example articles, monographs, books and book chapters, for researchers receiving grants as from October 2022. (For more information, see – Publishing open access - Swedish Research Council and Producing a data management plan - Swedish Research Council) A new contextualizing part has been introduced in the application process as a complement to the part that deal with the applicant's competence. In the applicant’s resume, the applicant can state "Publications and other research outputs”. That means that in the contextualizing part open access to publications and/or research data can also be described, as long as it is relevant for the call in question.

Yes – partly. There is no monitoring framework for open science as a whole. However, since 2017 there is a national monitoring on the development of open access to scholarly publications in terms of “Open access in numbers” maintained by the National Library of Sweden. Such indicators are also included in the presentation of the annual budgets from the government. The National Library of Sweden is also assigned to coordinate, monitor and foster cooperation in the area of open access to scholarly publications. The assignment is reported yearly to the government and made openly available. The Swedish Research Council is reporting since 2022 on yearly basis the development of the work on open access to research data, according to indicators for open access to research data (see more information and links in answer on 2.3). Report from 2024: Öppen tillgång till forskningsdata – en kartläggning, analys och bedömning 2024 - Vetenskapsrådet The Swedish Research Council is answering on the annual survey from European Open Science Clous Steering Board about “the National Contributions to EOSC”, which is connected to the indicators to monitor the EOSC readiness of countries in Europe. Results are presented in the EOSC Observatory, a tool for monitoring policies, practices, and impacts related to the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC): EOSC Observatory The Association of Swedish Higher Education Institutions conduct an annual survey about the work on open science, connected to their Roadmap on open science.
