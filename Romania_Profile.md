Digitalisation (MCID), in the context of the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF)
project: “Increasing the capacity of the RDI system to respond to global challenges” (SIPOCA 592
| MySMIS Code 127557
Stakeholders involved in the Development Process: Researchers and RDI community
stakeholders; UNESCO Chair on Science and Innovation Policies – SNSPA; the Romanian Open
Science Cloud Initiative (RO-NOSCI);
Year of Adoption: 2022; Year of Last Update: 2023
Key Areas/Sections of the Policy:
The White Paper was developed in correlation with international provisions and developments on
OS (among these, the UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science 2021, the EC
Recommendation (EU) 2018/790 of 25 April 2018 on access to and preservation of scientific
information, the Council conclusions on Research assessment and implementation of Open
Science of June 2022).
The White Paper on the Transition to Open Science (2023-2030) presents the vision, the strategic
objectives and necessary actions for the implementation of open science vision in Romania, in
aligment with international and european open science policies and recommendations. The
development of the White Paper is based on a consultation process initiated by UEFISCDI in
2020 and organized in several stages, through a series of workshops dedicated to identifying
Romania's strategic options on open science and dissemination events organized within the
NI4OS, OpenAire and other projects, as well as 2 national surveys developed by the Executive
Agency in 2021 on the understanding of the needs and familiarity with the open science practices
among the academic and research community.

• does it include any of the following open science elements:
o open access to scientific knowledge YES
o open science infrastructure YES
o open engagement of societal actors YES
o open dialogue with other knowledge systems YES

### B2.2: National policies/legal frameworks aligned with Recommendation
The White Paper aligns well with several UNESCO Open Science principles, particularly
regarding open access, public funding mandates, and governance discussions. However, it
lacks explicit coverage of multilingualism and indigenous knowledge protection.
a. Ensuring that open science incorporates values and principles to ensure shared and reciprocal
benefits, avoiding unfair extraction of data and knowledge
The white paper emphasizes equity in access to scientific information, addressing issues
related to the fairness of open science practices. It also references the need to prevent
unintended negative consequences of open science, such as high publication costs leading
to inequalities
b. Ensuring publicly funded research follows open science principles and its outputs are openly
licensed or dedicated to the public domain
The document strongly supports open access to publicly funded research and FAIR (Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles. It states that access to research
publications and data should be provided as early as possible and free of charge, in alignment
with European and international recommendations
c. Encouraging bibliodiversity, including diverse formats, business models, and humanities/social
sciences
The document acknowledges the importance of a diversity of open access publishing models
(e.g., Diamond Open Access), and mentions the need to encourage bibliodiversity.
d. - Encouraging multilingualism in scientific publications and academic communications
The document does not significantly address multilingualism in open science. Its focus is primarily
on accessibility, data openness, and publishing frameworks, but there is no dedicated section on
promoting research in multiple languages.
- Protecting the rights of indigenous communities, including traditional knowledge, per the 2007
UN Declaration
There is no direct mention of indigenous rights, traditional knowledge, or the role of indigenous
communities in open science practices.
h. Enabling open multi-stakeholder discussions on open science challenges (competition,
exploitation, IPR, privacy, security, inequalities)
The strategic document discusses the challenges of open science related to intellectual property,
data security, highlights the importance of stakeholder discussions and the role of governance
bodies in overseeing open science implementation

### B2.3: Specific policy instruments promoting open science
The National Plan for RDI 2022-2027 (PNCDI IV), the main instrument for implementing the
The National Research, Innovation and Smart Specialisation Strategy (SNCISI) 2022-2027
Types of support/ projects proposed to be funded within the time horizon 2022-2027:
Open science is one of the ten principles mentioned in the plan and the National Plan includes
RDI financing programs and types of projects proposed to be financed and which support open
science:
- developing the institutional capacity to implement open science practices (grants for the
development of OS skills),
- open access publication (APCs)
- preparation/ management of the research data (RDM),
- supporting the participation of RO and the relevant RO entities in/ for the development of
European Open Science Cloud - EOSC;
- exchange of best practices for the development of capabilities needed to implement open
science (grants);
- Science and Society Programme:
o Projects for the training of researchers in science communication;
o Science in schools,
o Festival of science, creativity and innovation,
o Science and technology summer schools,
o Supporting national and international scientific events.
o Innovation in citizen science (supporting exploratory activities for the development
of specific innovative methods and methodologies in order to engage citizens in
science, awarding successful projects with citizen science components)

### B2.4: National implementation plan / roadmap
As recent changes occured in the governmental structures, decisions regarding this
action will be possible after the UNESCO survey closes

### B2.5: Institutional open science policies
Partial monitoring of institutional policies for Open Science has indeed been carried
out by UEFISCDI through various consultations, in different projects and mainly in
associated to the development of the National Strategic Framework for the Transition to
Open Science (in 2021 - 2023). For example, at the end of 2023, a survey among RO-
NOSCI members identified that two institutions (one university and one research institute)
had developed an institutional Open Science policy and six others (four universities and 2
research institutes) declared having the policy under developement. The information has
not been updated as of now.
The National Research, Innovation and Smart Specialisation Strategy (SNCISI) 2022-2027
(OS.1.2.) includes the development of a Governance and Monitoring mechanism for Open
Science which is not in place yet.

### B2.6: National funding mechanisms for open science
APCs are eligible costs in puiblicly funded research: According to the Gov. Decision no.
134 of February 16, 2011, which approves the Methodological Norms for determining
categories of expenses for research and development activities and innovation stimulation
financed from the state budget, the publishing costs are considered eligible expenses.
RDMs costs are eligible costs in the National Research, Development and Innovation Plan
(PNCDI IV).
“Stiinta in scoli” funding instrument (PNCDI IV) to be launched in near future. It enhances
STEAM education through hands-on learning, team competitions, and science debates, lab
visits, expert lectures, and Fab-Lab student projects.
More details: https://uefiscdi.gov.ro/stiinta-in-scoli-ss-sc.
The Anelis Plus consortium in Romania (an association comprising Romanian universities,
research and development institutes, and central university libraries) supports the Open
Access publishing through transformative agreements with major publishers. These
agreements enable researchers from member institutions to publish their work openly without
additional fees, as the publication costs are covered by the consortium. The list of publishers
with whom agreements have been established includes Elsevier, IEEE, Royal Society of
Chemistry (RSC), Institute of Physics (IOP), Wiley, Cambridge University Press, Springer,
and Sage. More information on the Anelis Plus website: https://anelis-plus.ro/open-
access/acorduri-transformative-2024/
Apart from these, the actions mentioned already at 2.3. planned/ proposed in The
National Plan for RDI 2022-2027 (PNCDI IV)

### B2.7: Open science integrated into research funding
• In order to encourage the uptake of Open Science practices and to put into practice the
mandatory provision of the National Strategy, regarding the elaboration of data
management plans (DMPs), compliant with FAIR principles within the RDI projects financed
with public funds, OS related elements have been included as requirements in the funding
instrument Centres of Excellence (https://uefiscdi.gov.ro/centre-de-excelenta-coe-coe2023-
747). In the project description applicants are asked to describe OS practices used in the
project and correspondingly, evaluators will assess applications, considering also the
description provided for OS practices. These provisions regarding DMPs and FAIR data
were for the first time requested within any RDI funding programme.
• The requiremes and criteria have been extended to other funding instruments which are
planned to be launched in near future:
o Complex Frontier Research Projects: https://uefiscdi.gov.ro/news-dezbatere-publica-
proiecte-de-cercetare
o "Challenges - Change" [”Provocări - Schimbare” - PPS]: https://uefiscdi.gov.ro/news-
dezbatere-publica-pachet-informatii-provocari-schimbare-pps
These requirements and criteria will be included in other funding instruments – where
appropriate

### B2.9: National monitoring framework for open science
The monitoring framework for the SNSCI strategy is detailed in the Chapter Monitoring
(pages 105-109 - the English version, link).
Establishing and implementing a national governance and monitoring support mechanism
for the transition to open science is envisaged in the SNCISI (under the Objective
OS.1.2.) as follows:
Under the supervision of an Open Science Council which should be created as part
of the Ministry of Research (currently the National Research Authority, under the
subordination of the Ministry of Education and Research), this mechanism will
provide support for:
- the definition and implementation of open science-specific policies, the
- coordination of the development and implementation of the
- recommendations of the Strategic Document regarding the framework for
- the development and of open science in Romania;
- the development of specific open science capabilities;
- the coordination of the expert network at the level of research organisations;
- the coordination of the development of the management capacity for open
- science at the level of research organizations
Objective 5 from the White Paper on the Transition to Open Science for the time horizon
2023-2030 details the core provisions of the strategy, further expanding on the actions
needed to ensure a coherent Open Science Governance and a robust monitoring
mechanism while facilitating the national transition to open science.
The National Research, Innovation and Smart Specialisation Strategy (SNCISI)
2022-2027 provides indicators from the SNCISI Nomenclature associated with the
national target (ANNEX 1 of the strategy, for English version - link), and corresponding to
the OS.1.2. Ensure the transition to open science and facilitate the consolidation of
excellence in scientific research:
• S14 – Share of Web of Science (WoS) publications in Open Access
• IS-P1 – Number of Web of Science (WoS) indexed articles, including those
published in Open Access and international scientific co-publications
• IS-P2 – Number of scientific articles with research datasets published in Open
Access

## B5: Research Assessment & Incentives

### B5.1: Review of research assessment processes
The dialogue about rethinking the existing research assessment and evaluation processes
has already started at national level since the development of the White Book of the
Transition to Open Science. During the consultation on the Green Book of the Transition
to Open Science (18 August-30 September 2022) out of 186 respodents, 88% indicated
that Recommendation 7 (final form as the Objective 7 in the White Paper - Adapting the
Research Evaluation and Rewarding Process to the New Context of Open Science) is
highly or very highly relevant to their work, 8% stated that this recommendation has medium
relevance, and 4% specified that its relevance is low or very low. The respondents
emphasize the need for fundamental changes in the evaluation system, with clear and
realistic criteria prioritizing public dissemination of research.
A key element of this transformation is international collaboration. Many believed that
integrating foreign experts into the evaluation process would enhance credibility and align
research standards with those of the European Union. At the same time, transparency must
become a cornerstone of the system. Removing confidentiality from the evaluation
process—both for reviewers and authors—was seen as a crucial step toward accountability,
helping to eliminate conflicts of interest and ensuring fairer assessments.
Yet, beyond evaluation reforms, respondents stress the pressing need for increased
research funding and a revised system for rewarding researchers. Open science practices
should not be implemented in isolation but should be part of a broader shift in how research
is valued and incentivized.
Despite this optimism, concerns linger. Some warned that changing evaluation and reward
systems alone will not be enough - these shifts must be accompanied by systematic
reforms. More discussions on these topics should be encouraged, as they are crucial for
ensuring meaningful progress. Others proposed a practical approach: opening funding
lines for pilot programs to test new evaluation methods before implementing sweeping
changes (as it started in 2023 with the funding instrument “Centers of Excellence”
described at the Q 1.4.). However, there is also a note of caution - some research areas
deal with sensitive information, and in such cases, national interests must be safeguarded.
Not all respondents were in favor of the recommendations related to research evaluation
in the Green Book; major obstacles like inadequate funding and a shortage of qualified
evaluators were mentioned. They also express deep concerns over intellectual property
rights and the risks of prematurely sharing sensitive research data. Without proper
safeguards, they argue such openness could do more harm than good.
As the debate continues it is clear that the path to reform is complex. While many see open
science as the future, its success depends on careful implementation, sufficient resources,
and a balanced approach that considers both progress and protection.
The report of the consultation on the Green Book of the transition to Open Science:
https://www.open-science.ro/resurse/raport-al-rezultatelor-consultarii-privind-cartea-
verde-a-tranzitiei-catre-stiinta-deschisa-2022-2030
The National Strategy promotes rethinking research assessment and the Objective 7 of the
White Paper on the Transition to Open Science is dedicated to describing actions to start
Adapting the process of research assessment and rewarding in the new context of open
science. These can be summarized as follows:
Reviewing Evaluation Processes: Assess current research evaluation methods (for
researchers, projects, and institutions) to determine how well they support and encourage
open science practices.
Developing New Evaluation Criteria: Update or create new evaluation methods, tools, and
indicators in collaboration with the research community to recognize and reward open
science practices, including early data sharing, open collaboration, public access, and
broader research outputs.
Ongoing Monitoring and Review: Periodically assess evaluation processes to ensure
effectiveness and efficiency.
Transparency and Communication: Ensure clear and accessible information about
evaluation methods, tools, and criteria, with active involvement from relevant stakeholders.
Support Actions - Working Groups & Events: Establish working groups and organize events
to facilitate dialogue and consultation on evaluation reforms.
Support Actions - Guidance Materials: Develop informational guides to help research
organizations update their evaluation systems and implement recognition and reward
mechanisms for open science practices.
In order to continue the dialogue towards rethinking research assessment, discussions are
organized with the national community, such as the Rethinking Research Assessment
Conference, organized on November 14, 2024 by UEFISCDI, in collaboration with the
Open and Universal Science project (OPUS), Science Europe, the Coalition for Advancing
Research Assessment (CoARA), and the UNESCO Chair on Science and Innovation
Policies (SNSPA). Event Details.
Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment (CoARA): 25 institutions from Romania are
members of the CoARA
Also a CoARA member, UEFISCDI has recently developed its Action Plan for CoARA for
the period between 2025 and 2028. The document outlines the Agency’s commitment and
(planned) actions meant to contribute to the alignment of its research assessment practices,
as well as of the ones from national level, with the principles of the Agreement on Reforming
Research Assessment (ARRA). It focuses on implementing activities around a series of
main elements, such as narrative CVs, the responsible use of research metrics, recognizing
Open Science and Research Data Management practices in funding calls, a new format for
research outputs list and a limited number for outputs, and other.
So far, evaluation criteria related to Data Management Plans (DMPs) and Open Science
have been included in the funding instrument “Centers of Excellence”. Applicants have
been required to describe how open science practices (e.g. Open Access to publications,
research data management, citizen science, and other) are implemented in their project to
enhance its objectives. If no open science practices are applied, a justification is required.
Additionally, the applicants have been asked to describe the research data management
(RDM) aligned with FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable). If
funded, a Data Management Plan (DMP) is required within the first six months of the
project’s implementation. More info: https://uefiscdi.gov.ro/centre-de-excelenta-coe-
coe2023-747
These requiremes and criteria have been extended to other funding instruments which are
planned to be launched in near future:
o Complex Frontier Research Projects: https://uefiscdi.gov.ro/news-dezbatere-publica-
proiecte-de-cercetare
o "Challenges - Change" [”Provocări - Schimbare” - PPS]: https://uefiscdi.gov.ro/news-
dezbatere-publica-pachet-informatii-provocari-schimbare-pps
These requirements and criteria will be included in other funding instruments – where
appropriate.
In addition, until 2027, UEFISCDI is also implementing activities that aim to reflect on
existing good practices for performance based research funding mechanisms addressed
to higher education institutions, and subsequnently provide recommendations for such
potential mechanisms that could be of interest at national level. In order to do so, it will look
at research assessment practices in a coherent way, trying to consider the alignment of
practices for all three types of evaluands – researchers, project proposals and institutions.
The activity will involve a large consultation process at national level with research
communities and Open Science practices will be discussed together with a variety of types
of other contributions to research as potential contributions that can be recognized in PBRF
mechanisms. This initiative is carried part of the project Romania on the horizon 2030:
Increasing international relevance through the internationalization of higher education
(Activity 4), funded through ESF and national funds: https://uefiscdi.gov.ro/romania-la-
orizont-2030-cresterea-relevantei-internationale-prin-internationalizarea-invatamantului-
superior

### B5.2: Open science practices in career evaluation
It’s a partial yes, as currently, career evaluation and progression systems in Romanian
academia acknowledge especially Open Access but with significant restrictions, primarily
emphasizing quality over accessibility. These are based on the recently adopted national
minimum standards for the conferment of the title of associate professor, full professor, and
habilitation certification were adopted through a ministerial order published on Tuesday,
February 12, in the Official Gazette of Romania. (Official source: Monitorul Oficial al
României).
While Open Access publishing is supported, journals that charge mandatory publication
fees are often excluded from evaluation criteria (e.g., Mathematics, Informatics). The
Chemistry Commission allows fee-based journals but limits their proportion within an
applicant’s publication record.
Beyond Open Access, other Open Science practice (such as open data, open peer review,
and citizen science) - are not explicitly incorporated into career assessments. The only
notable exception is in Mathematics, where preprints on arXiv.org are recognized as a
legitimate way to share research. However, collaboration with non-scientific actors,
interdisciplinary knowledge-sharing, and engagement beyond academia are not included
in evaluation frameworks, nor are there specific provisions to introduce them by 2025. The
primary focus across scientific commissions remains on scientific impact, citations, and
adherence to ethical research standards, rather than broader Open Science principles.

### B5.3: Initiatives to recognise/reward open science practices
Open science practises are recognized in the evaluation phase of certain research grants:
- The Centers of Excellence: https://uefiscdi.gov.ro/centre-de-excelenta-coe-
coe2023-747
- Complex Frontier Research Projects: https://uefiscdi.gov.ro/news-dezbatere-
publica-proiecte-de-cercetare
- "Challenges - Change" [”Provocări - Schimbare” - PPS]:
https://uefiscdi.gov.ro/news-dezbatere-publica-pachet-informatii-provocari-
schimbare-pps

### B5.4: Challenges and additional observations
n 2021, debates have sparkled around the rising trend of publishing in Open Access in
MDPI. The public debates were carried about the quality and impact of such publications,
especially considering MDPI's rapid expansion and the proliferation of some special
issues, which some argue may compromise academic standards. Additionally,
discussions on certain media and opinions platforms have delved into the broader
implications of open access publishing and concerns have been raised about the financial
burden placed on institutions and the potential shift in focus from research quality to
quantity, driven by the need to cover publication fees and achieve higher output metrics.
These developments underscore the need for a balanced approach to open access
publishing in Romania, ensuring that the drive for accessibility does not compromise
research integrity or lead to unsustainable financial practices.
